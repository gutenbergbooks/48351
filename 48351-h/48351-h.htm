<h2>WONDER TALES
FROM MANY LANDS</h2>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>LONG, BROAD, AND SHARPSIGHT<br />

<small>A STORY FROM BOHEMIA</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>THERE was once a King who had one only
son, and him he loved better than anything
in the whole world—better even
than his own life. The King’s greatest desire was
to see his son married, but though the Prince
had travelled in many lands, and had seen many
noble and beautiful ladies, there was not one
among them all whom he wished to have for a
wife.</p>

<p>One day the King called his son to him and
said, “My son, for a long time now I have hoped
to see you choose a bride, but you have desired
no one. Take now this silver key. Go to the
top of the castle, and there you will see a steel
door. This key will unlock it. Open the door
and enter. Look carefully at everything in the
room, and then return and tell me what you
have seen. But, whatever you do, do not touch
nor draw aside the curtain that hangs at the right
of the door. If you should disobey me and do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
this thing, you will suffer the greatest dangers,
and may even pay for it with your life.”</p>

<p>The Prince wondered greatly at his father’s
words, but he took the key and went to the top
of the castle, and there he found the steel door
his father had described. He unlocked it with
the silver key, stepped inside, and looked about
him. When he had done so, he was filled with
amazement at what he saw. The room had
twelve sides, and on eleven of these sides were
pictures of eleven princesses more beautiful than
any the Prince had ever seen in all his life before.
Moreover, these pictures were as though they
were alive. When the Prince looked at them,
they moved and smiled and blushed and beckoned
to him. He went from one to the other, and they
were so beautiful that each one he looked upon
seemed lovelier than the last. But lovely though
they were, there was not one of them whom the
Prince wished to have for a wife.</p>

<p>Last of all, the Prince came to the twelfth side
of the room, and it was covered over with a curtain,
and the curtain was of velvet richly embroidered
with gold and precious stones. The Prince stood
before it and looked at it and looked at it. He
tried to peer under its edges, but he could see
nothing; never in all his life had he longed for
anything as he longed to lift that curtain and see
what was behind it.</p>

<p>At last his longing grew so great that he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
withstand it no longer. He laid his hand upon
the folds and drew it aside, and when he had done
so, his heart melted within him for love and joy.
For there was the portrait of a maiden so fair and
lovely that all the other eleven beauties were as
nothing beside her.</p>

<p>The Prince stood and looked at her, and she
looked back at him, and she did not blush or
beckon to him as the others had done, but rather
she grew pale.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the Prince at last, “you and you
only shall be my bride, even though I should have
to go to the ends of the world to find you.”</p>

<p>When he said that, the picture bowed its head
gravely.</p>

<p>Then the Prince dropped the curtain and left
the room and went down to where the old King
was waiting for him. As soon as he came before
his father, the old man asked whether he had
found the room and entered it.</p>

<p>“I did,” answered the Prince.</p>

<p>“And what did you see in the room, my
son?”</p>

<p>“I saw a picture of the maiden whom I wish to
have for a wife.”</p>

<p>“And which of the eleven was it?”</p>

<p>“It was none of the eleven; it was the twelfth—she
whose portrait hangs behind the curtain.”</p>

<p>When the old King heard this, he gave a cry
of grief. “Alas, alas, my son! What have you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
done! Did I not warn you not to lift the curtain
and not to look behind it?”</p>

<p>“You warned me, my father, and yet I could
not but look, and now I have seen the only one
whom I will ever marry. Tell me, I pray of you,
who she is, that I may go in search of her.”</p>

<p>“Well did I know that misfortune would come
upon you if ever you entered that room. That
Princess whom you have seen is indeed the most
beautiful Princess in all the world, but she is also
the most unfortunate. Because of her beauty,
she was carried away by a wicked and powerful
Magician who wished to marry her. To this,
however, she would not consent. He still keeps
her a prisoner in an iron castle far away beyond
forest, plain, and mountain at the very end of
the world. Many princes and heroes and brave
men have tried to rescue her, but none has ever
succeeded. They have lost their lives in the
attempt, and the Magician has turned them all
into stone statues to adorn his castle. And now
you are determined to throw away your life also.”</p>

<p>“That may be,” said the Prince; “and yet
it may also be that I shall succeed even though
others have failed. At any rate, I must try, for
I cannot live without her.”</p>

<p>When the King found that his son was determined
to go, and that nothing could stay him,
he gave him a jewelled sword and the finest steed
in his stable and bade him God-speed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>So the Prince set out with his father’s blessing,
and he rode along and rode along until at last he
came to a forest that was so vast there seemed to
be no end to it. In this forest he quite lost his
way. He was therefore very glad when he saw
some one trudging along in front of him.</p>

<p>The Prince rode on until he overtook the man,
and then he reined in his horse and bade him
good day.</p>

<p>“Good day,” answered the man.</p>

<p>“Do you know the ways through this forest?”
asked the Prince.</p>

<p>“No, I know nothing about them, but that
never bothers me. If at any time I think I am
going in the wrong direction, it is easy to right
myself.”</p>

<p>“How is that?” said the Prince.</p>

<p>“Oh, I have the power of stretching myself out
to any length, and if I lose my way I have only
to make myself tall enough to see over the tree-tops,
and then I can easily tell where I am.”</p>

<p>“That must be very curious. I should like to
see that,” said the Prince.</p>

<p>Well, that was easy enough, and the man would
be glad enough to oblige him. So he began to
stretch himself. He stretched and stretched and
stretched until he was taller than the tallest tree
in the forest. His head and body were quite
lost to sight among the branches, and all that the
Prince could see were his legs and feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is that enough?” the man called down to the
Prince.</p>

<p>“Yes, that is enough,” answered the Prince,
and he had to shout to make himself heard, the
man’s head was so far away.</p>

<p>Then the man began to shrink. He shrank and
shrank until he was no taller than the Prince
himself.</p>

<p>“You are a wonderful fellow,” said the Prince.
“What is your name?”</p>

<p>The man’s name was Long.</p>

<p>“And what did you see up there?”</p>

<p>“I saw a plain and great mountains beyond,
and still beyond that an iron castle, and it was
so far away that it must be at the very end of
the world.”</p>

<p>“It is that castle that I am seeking,” said the
Prince, “and now I see that you are the very
man to guide me there. Tell me, Long, will you
take service with me? If you will, I will pay you
well.”</p>

<p>Yes, Long would do that, and not for the sake
of the money either, but because he had taken a
fancy to the Prince.</p>

<p>So the Prince and his new servant travelled
along together, and presently they came out of
the forest on to a plain, and there, far in front
of them, was another man also travelling along
toward the mountains.</p>

<p>“Look, Master!” said Long. “Do you see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
that man? His name is Broad. You ought to
have him for a servant too, for he is even more
wonderful than I am.”</p>

<p>“Call him, then,” said the Prince, “and I will
speak with him.”</p>

<p>No, Long could not call him, for Broad was too
far away to hear him, but he could soon overtake
him. So Long stretched himself out until he was
tall enough to go half a mile at every step. In
this way he soon overtook Broad and stopped
him, and then he and Broad waited until the
Prince had caught up to them.</p>

<p>“Good day,” said the Prince to Broad.</p>

<p>“Good day,” answered Broad.</p>

<p>“My servant here tells me that you are a very
wonderful person,” said the Prince. “What can
you do that is so wonderful?”</p>

<p>What Broad could do was to spread himself
out until he was as broad across as he wished
to be.</p>

<p>“I should like to see that,” said the Prince.</p>

<p>Very well! Nothing was easier, and Broad was
willing to show him. “But first,” said Broad,
“do you get behind those rocks over yonder.
Otherwise you may get hurt. And now I will
begin.”</p>

<p>“Quick! quick, Master!” cried Long, in a
voice of fear. “We have not a moment to lose,”
and he ran at full speed and crouched down
behind the rocks. The Prince followed him, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
he also got behind the rocks, but he did not know
why Long was in such a hurry, nor why he seemed
so frightened. He soon saw, however, for when
Broad began to spread, he spread so fast and
with such force that unless the Prince and Long
had been behind the rocks, they would certainly
have been pushed against them and crushed.</p>

<p>“Is that enough?” cried Broad, after he had
spread out so wide that the Prince could scarcely
see across him.</p>

<p>“Yes, that is enough.”</p>

<p>So Broad began to shrink, and soon he was no
fatter than he had been before.</p>

<p>“Yes, you are certainly a very wonderful fellow,
and I should like to have you for a servant,” said
the Prince. “Will you come with me also?”</p>

<p>Yes, Broad would come, for a master who was
good enough for Long was good enough for him
too. So now the Prince had two servants. He
rode on across the plain toward the mountains,
and the two followed him.</p>

<p>After a while they came to a man sitting by the
way with a bandage over his eyes. The Prince
stopped and spoke to him.</p>

<p>“Are you blind, my poor fellow, that you wear
a bandage over your eyes?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered the man, “I am not blind. I
wear the bandage because I see too well without
it. Even now, with this bandage, I can see as
clearly as you ever can. If I take it off, I can see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
for hundreds of miles, and when I look at anything
steadily my sight is so strong that the
thing is riven to pieces, or bursts into flame and
is burned.”</p>

<p>“That is a very curious thing,” said the Prince.
“Could you break yonder rock to pieces merely
by looking at it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I could do that.”</p>

<p>“I would like to see it done,” said the Prince.</p>

<p>Well, the man was ready to oblige him. So
he took the bandage from his eyes and fixed his
gaze on the rock. First the rock grew hot, and
then it smoked, and then, with a great noise, it
exploded into tiny fragments, so that the pieces
flew about through the air.</p>

<p>“Yes, you are even more wonderful than these
other two,” said the Prince, “and they are wonderful
enough. How are you called?”</p>

<p>“My name is Sharpsight.”</p>

<p>“Well, Sharpsight, will you take service with
me, for I need just such a servant as you?”</p>

<p>Yes, Sharpsight would do that; so now the
Prince had three servants, and they were such
servants as no one in the world ever had before.</p>

<p>They travelled along over the plain, and at last
they came to the foot of the mountain that lay
between them and the iron castle.</p>

<p>“Now we must either go over it or round it,”
said the Prince; “and which shall it be?”</p>

<p>“No need for that, Master,” answered Sharpsight.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
“Just let me unbandage my eyes, but be
careful you are not struck by any of the flying
pieces when the mountain begins to split.”</p>

<p>So the Prince and Broad and Long took shelter
behind a clump of trees, and then Sharpsight
uncovered his eyes. He fixed his eyes on the
mountain, and presently it began to groan and
split and splinter. Pieces of sharp rock and
stones flew through the air. It was not long
before Sharpsight’s gaze had bored a way
straight through the mountain and out on the
other side. Then he put back the bandage over
his eyes and called to the Prince that the way
was clear.</p>

<p>The Prince and his companions came out from
their shelter, and when they saw the way that
Sharpsight had made through the mountain they
could not wonder enough. It was so broad and
clear that ten men could have ridden through it
abreast.</p>

<p>With such a way before them it did not take
them long to go through the mountain, and then
they found themselves in the country beyond,
and a black and terrible land it was too. Nowhere
was there any sound or sign of life. There
were fields, but no grass. There were trees, but
they bore neither leaves nor fruit. There was a
river, but it did not flow, and there was light,
and yet they saw no sun. But darker and
gloomier than all the rest was the castle which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
rose before them. It was the iron castle where
the Black Magician lived.</p>

<p>There was a moat round the castle and an iron
bridge across it. The companions rode across
the bridge, and no sooner were they over than
the bridge rose behind them and they were
prisoners.</p>

<p>They could not have turned back even if they
had wished to, but none of them had any thought
of such a thing.</p>

<p>The Prince struck with his sword upon the
great door of the castle, and at once it opened
before him, but when he entered he saw no one.
Before him was a great hall, and on either side
of it was a long row of stone figures. These
statues were all figures of knights and kings and
princes. The Prince looked at them and wondered,
for they were so lifelike that it seemed
scarcely possible to believe that they were of
stone.</p>

<p>He and his companions went on farther into
the castle, and everywhere they found rooms
magnificently furnished, but silent and deserted.
Nowhere was there any sign of life.</p>

<p>Last of all they entered what seemed to be a
dining-hall. Here was a table set with the most
delicious things to eat and drink. There were
four places about the table, and one of them was
somewhat higher than the others, as though intended
for the prince or king.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>“One might think this table had been set for
us,” said the Prince. “We will wait for a while,
and then, if no one comes, we will eat, at any
rate.”</p>

<p>They waited for some time and then took their
places at the table. At once invisible hands filled
the goblets and other invisible hands passed the
dishes.</p>

<p>The Prince and his companions ate and drank
all they wished, and then they rose from the table,
meaning to look farther through the castle.</p>

<p>At this moment the door opened and a tall
man with a long grey beard came into the room.
From head to foot he was dressed entirely in
black velvet, even to his cap and shoes, and
round his waist his robe was fastened with three
iron bands. In one hand was an ivory wand,
curiously carved; with the other he led a lady
so beautiful, and yet so pale and sad-looking, that
the heart ached to look at her. The moment the
Prince saw her he knew her as the one whose
picture he had seen behind the golden curtain—the
one whom he had said should be his bride.</p>

<p>The Magician, for it was he, spoke at once to
the Prince. “I know why you have come here,
and that you hope to win this Princess for your
bride. Many others have come here with the
same wish and have failed. Now you shall have
your turn. For three nights you must watch here
with her. If each morning I return and find her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
still with you, then you shall have her for a
bride after the third morning. But if she is
gone, you shall be turned into a stone statue, such
as those you have already seen about my palace.”</p>

<p>“That ought not to be a hard task,” said the
Prince. “Gladly will I watch with her for three
nights; if in the morning you find her gone, I
am willing to suffer whatever you will. But my
three companions must also watch with me.”</p>

<p>Yes, the Magician was willing to agree to that,
so he left the lady there with the four, and then
went away, closing the door behind him.</p>

<p>As soon as the Magician had gone the Prince
and his followers made ready to guard the room
so that no one could come in to take the lady
away, nor could she herself leave without their
knowing it.</p>

<p>Long lay down and stretched himself out until
he encircled the whole room, and anyone who
went in or out would have to step over him.
Sharpsight sat down to watch, while Broad stood
in the doorway and made himself so broad that
no one could possibly have squeezed in past him.
Meanwhile the Prince tried to talk to the lady,
but she would not look at him nor answer him.</p>

<p>In this way some time passed, and then suddenly
the Prince began to feel very drowsy. He
tried to rouse himself, but in spite of his efforts
his eyes closed, and he fell into a deep sleep.</p>

<p>It was not until the early morning that he woke.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Then he roused himself and looked about him.
His companions too were only just opening their
eyes, for they, like himself, had been asleep, and
the lady was gone from the room.</p>

<p>When the Prince saw this he began to groan
and lament, but his companions told him not to
despair.</p>

<p>“Wait until I see if I can tell you where she is,”
said Sharpsight. He leaned from the window and
looked about.</p>

<p>“Yes, I see her,” he said. “A hundred miles
away from here is a forest. In that forest is an
oak-tree. On the topmost bough of that oak-tree is
an acorn, and in that acorn is the Princess hidden.”</p>

<p>“But what good is it to know where she is
unless we can get her back before the Magician
comes?” cried the Prince. “It would take us
days to journey there and to return.”</p>

<p>“Not so long as that, Master,” answered Long.
“Have patience for a moment until I see what
I can do.” He then stepped outside and made
himself so tall that he could go ten miles at a step.
He set Sharpsight on his shoulder to show him
the way, and away he went, and he made such
good time that he was back in the castle again
before the Prince could have walked three times
round the room.</p>

<p>“Here, Master,” he said, “here is the acorn.
Take it and throw it upon the floor.”</p>

<p>The Prince threw the acorn upon the floor, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
at once it flew open, and there stood the Princess
before him.</p>

<p>Hardly had this happened when the door
opened and the Magician came into the room.
When he saw the Princess he gave a cry of rage,
and one of the iron bands about his middle broke
with a loud noise.</p>

<p>He looked at the Prince, and his eyes flashed as
if with red fire. “This time you have succeeded
in keeping the Princess with you,” he cried, “but
do not be too sure that you can do the same thing
again. To-night you shall try once more.”</p>

<p>So saying he went away, taking the Princess
with him. In the evening he came again, and
again he brought the Princess.</p>

<p>“Watch her well,” said he to the Prince, with
an evil smile. “Remember, if she is not still
here to-morrow morning you will share the fate
of the others who have tried to watch her and
have failed.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” answered the Prince. “What
must be must be, and I can only do my best.”</p>

<p>The Magician then went away, leaving the
Princess with them as before.</p>

<p>The Prince and his companions had determined
that this night they would stay awake, whatever
happened, but presently their eyelids grew as heavy
as lead, and soon, in spite of themselves, they
all fell into a deep sleep.</p>

<p>When they awoke the day was breaking, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the Princess had again disappeared. The Prince
was ready to tear his hair with despair, but Sharpsight
bade him take heart.</p>

<p>“Wait until I take a look about,” he said.
“If I cannot see her, then it will be time for you
to despair.”</p>

<p>He leaned from the window, and first he looked
east, and then he looked west, and then he looked
toward the north. “Yes, now I see her,” he
said, “but she is far enough away. Two hundred
miles from here is a desert. In that desert is a
rock, in that rock is a golden ring, and that ring
is the Princess.”</p>

<p>“That is far away indeed,” groaned the Prince,
“and at any moment the Magician may be here.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, Master,” cried Long. “Two
hundred miles is not so far when one can go
twenty miles at a step.” He then made himself
twice as tall as the day before, and taking Sharpsight
on his shoulders he set out for the desert.</p>

<p>It was not long before he was back again, and
in his hand he carried the golden ring. “If it
had not been for Sharpsight,” he said, “I would
have been forced to bring back the whole rock
with me, but he fixed his eyes upon it, and at
once it split into a thousand pieces and the ring
fell out. Here! Take the ring, Master, quick,
and throw it upon the floor.”</p>

<p>The Prince did so, and as soon as the ring touched
the ground it was transformed into the Princess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>At this moment the Magician opened the door
and came into the room. When he saw the
Princess he stopped short, and his face turned
black with rage and fear. At the same moment
the second band about his middle flew apart.</p>

<p>“Ah, well!” he cried to the Prince, “no
doubt you think you are very clever, but remember
there is still another night, and next
time you may not prove so lucky in keeping the
Princess with you.”</p>

<p>So saying he went away with the Princess, and
the Prince saw him no more until evening. Then
for the third time he came, and brought the
Princess with him.</p>

<p>“Watch her well,” said he, “for I promise you
will not have so easy a task this time as you
have had before.”</p>

<p>Then he went away, and the four comrades
set themselves to watch. But again all happened
as it had before. In spite of themselves they could
not stay awake. First they nodded and then they
snored, and then they fell into such a deep sleep
that if the walls had fallen about them they would
not have known it. For this was an enchanted
sleep that the Magician had thrown upon them
in order to take away the Princess.</p>

<p>Not until day began to dawn did the four
awake, and when they did there was nothing to
be seen of the Princess.</p>

<p>“Well, she is not here in the room,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Sharpsight, “so methinks I’d better look outside.”</p>

<p>Then he leaned from the window, and for a
long time he looked about him. At last he spoke.
“Master, I see the Princess, but to bring her
back will not be such an easy task as it was
before. Three hundred miles from here is a sea.
At the bottom of the sea is a shell. In that shell
is a pearl, and that pearl is the Princess. But
to bring that pearl up from the sea is a task for
Broad as well as Long.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the Prince, “then Long must
take Broad with him on one shoulder. Only make
haste and return again quickly, in heaven’s name,
or the Magician may be here before you are back,
and we shall be turned into stone.”</p>

<p>Well, the three servants were willing enough
to be off. Long stretched himself out until he
was three times as tall as he had been the first
time, and that was the most he could stretch.
Then he went away, thirty miles at a step. At
that rate it was no time before he came to the
sea. But the sea was fathoms deep, and the
shell lay at the very bottom of it, and try as he
might he could not reach it.</p>

<p>“Now it is my turn,” said Broad. Then he
lay down and put his mouth to the sea and began
to drink. He drank and drank and swelled and
swelled until it was wonderful to see him, and in
the end he swallowed so much of the water that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
it was easy enough for Long to reach down and
pick up the shell.</p>

<p>“And now we must make haste,” cried Sharpsight,
“for as I look back at the castle I see
that the Magician is already waking.”</p>

<p>At once Long took his companions on his
shoulders and started back the way he had come.
But Broad had drunk so much water and was
so heavy that Long could not go as fast as he
otherwise would. “Broad, you will have to wait
here, and I will come back for you later,” he
cried, and with that he threw Broad down from
his shoulder as though he had been a sack full
of grain.</p>

<p>Broad had not been expecting such a fall and
was not prepared for it. He gasped and choked,
and then the sea he had swallowed rose all about
them; it filled the valley and washed up over
the foot of the mountains. Long was so tall that
he was able to wade out of it, though the water
was up to his waist, and Sharpsight too was safe,
for he was on Long’s shoulder; but Broad was
like to have been drowned. He only saved himself
by catching hold of Long’s hand, and so he
was drawn out of the water and up on dry land.</p>

<p>“That was a pretty trick to play upon me,”
he gasped and spluttered.</p>

<p>But Long had no time to answer him, for
already Sharpsight was whispering in his ear
that the Magician had awakened and was now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
on his way to the Prince. He caught Broad by
the belt and swung him up on his shoulder, and
this he could easily do, because now Broad was
so shrunken that he was quite light.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 454px;">
<img src="images/i_028fp.jpg" width="454" height="587" alt="Prince, princess and large black bird" />
<div class="caption">THERE WAS A GREAT BLACK RAVEN IN THE
ROOM WITH THEM</div>
</div>

<p>In two more steps Long had reached the castle,
but already the Magician was opening the door of
the chamber where the Prince was.</p>

<p>“Quick! Quick!” cried Sharpsight. “Throw
the pearl in at the window.”</p>

<p>And indeed there was no time to be lost. Long
threw the pearl in through the window, and the
moment it touched the floor it turned into the
Princess. She stood there before the Prince, no
longer pale and sad, but smiling and as rosy as
the dawn.</p>

<p>Already the Magician was in the room, with
an evil smile upon his face. When he saw the
Princess standing there he gave a cry so loud
and terrible that the whole castle shook with it.
And now the third iron band that was about his
waist broke.</p>

<p>At once the black velvet robe that had been
held about him by the bands rose and spread
into two great black wings. His eyes shrank,
his nose grew long and sharp, and instead of the
Magician there was a great black raven in the
room with them. Heavily flapping, it rose from
the ground. Three times round the room it flew,
croaking mournfully, and then out through the
window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>And now through all the castle arose a stir
and hum of life. The stone figures in the hall
stirred and looked about them, and stepped down,
no longer cold dead stone, but living, breathing
people. They were those who had come to the
castle to search for the Princess, and had been
bewitched by the Magician and turned into
statues; the evil charm was broken, and they
were alive once more.</p>

<p>When they found that it was the Prince and
his followers who had delivered them they did
not know how to thank them enough. They
could not even grudge the Princess to the Prince,
for it was he who had brought them back to life.
They all said they would return with the Prince
to his own country, so as to be at the wedding
when he was married to the Princess.</p>

<p>And what a wedding it was! There was
enough cake and ale for all to feast to their
hearts’ content.</p>

<p>The old King was so happy that he at once
made over the kingdom to his son, that he and
his bride might reign.</p>

<p>As for the three companions, they ate and
drank till they were full, and then they set out
into the world again. The Prince begged and
entreated them to stay with him, but they would
not. They were too fond of travelling about the
world, and for all I know they may be in some
corner of it still.</p>

<h2>THE DWARF WITH THE GOLDEN BEARD<br />

<small>A SLAVONIC FAIRY TALE</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>THE Princess Beautiful was the daughter
of the King of the Silver Mountains, and
she was no less lovely than her name.
Because of her beauty many heroes and princes
came to her father’s kingdom, all seeking her in
marriage. The Princess cared for none of them,
however, except the young Prince Dobrotek.
Him she loved with all her heart, and her father
was quite willing that she should choose him for
a husband, for the Prince was rich and powerful
as well as handsome.</p>

<p>The marriage between them was arranged, and
the guests from far and near were invited to
attend. Among those asked was a dwarf who had
also been a suitor for the hand of the Princess.</p>

<p>This dwarf was a very powerful magician, and
as he was very malicious as well as powerful,
he was greatly feared by every one. He was
scarcely two feet high, and so ugly that it was
enough to frighten one only to look at him. His
great pride was his beard, which was seven feet
long, and every hair of it was of pure gold.
Because of its length he wore it twisted round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
and round his neck like a golden collar. Thus he
avoided tripping over it at every step.</p>

<p>When this dwarf heard that the Princess was
to marry Dobrotek he was filled with rage and
chagrin. In spite of his hideousness he was so
vain of his beard that he could not imagine why
the Princess should have chosen another instead
of himself. He swore that even still she should
take him for a husband, and that if she did
not do this then she should marry no one. However,
he said nothing of this vow to anyone. He
accepted the invitation to the wedding, and when
the day came he was one of the first of the guests
to arrive.</p>

<p>All went to the church and took their places,
and when the Prince and Princess stood before
the altar they were so handsome that every one
was filled with admiration.</p>

<p>The priest opened his book and was just about
to make them man and wife when a frightful
noise arose outside. It was a sound of whistling
and roaring and rending. Then the doors were
burst open, and a terrible hurricane swept into
the church.</p>

<p>The guests were so frightened that they hid
themselves under the seats, but the storm touched
none of them. It swept up the aisle and caught
up the Princess Beautiful as though she were a
feather. The Prince threw his arms about her
and tried to hold her. But he could do nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
against such a hurricane. She was torn from
his grasp and swept out of the church and away,
no one knew whither.</p>

<p>When the storm was over the people came out
from under the seats and looked about them,
but look as they might they could see no bride.
Only the Prince was standing before the altar,
tearing his hair with despair because the Princess
was lost to him.</p>

<p>And well might he despair, for the hurricane
that had carried the Princess away was no common
storm. It had been raised by the wicked
enchantments of the dwarf, and had swept
Princess Beautiful far away, over plain and
mountain, over sea and forest, to the very castle
of the dwarf himself. There she was lying in an
enchanted sleep, and it would be a bold man
who could hope to rescue her.</p>

<p>When the King of the Silver Mountains found
his daughter gone he was in a terrible rage. “It
was for you to save her,” cried he to the Prince.
“She was your bride, and you should have lost
your life before you allowed her to be torn from
you.”</p>

<p>To this the Prince answered nothing, for he
thought the same himself. Yet who can stand
against magic? Only enchantment, indeed,
could have prevailed against him.</p>

<p>“Go!” cried the King, “find her and bring
her back to me, or your life shall answer for it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>The Prince wished nothing better than to go
in search of his bride. Life was worth nothing
to him without her, and at once he made ready
to depart. He was in such haste that he stopped
for neither sword nor armour, but leaped upon
his horse and rode forth as he was.</p>

<p>On and on he rode, many miles and many
leagues, but the farther he rode the less he heard
of the Princess, and the more he despaired of
ever finding her. At last he entered a forest so
dark and vast that it seemed to have no end.
As he rode on through the shadows he suddenly
heard a sharp and piteous cry. He looked about
him to see whence it came, and presently he
found a hare struggling in the clutch of a great
grey owl.</p>

<p>The Prince had a kind heart. He seized a
stick and quickly drove the owl away from its
prey. For awhile the hare lay stretched out and
panting, but presently it recovered itself.</p>

<p>“Prince,” it said to Dobrotek, “you have
saved my life, and I am not ungrateful. I know
why you are here and whom you seek. To rescue
the Princess Beautiful will be no easy task. It
was the Dwarf of the Golden Beard who raised
the tempest that carried the Princess away.
Even now he holds her a prisoner in his castle.
Whoever would rescue her must first overcome
the dwarf, and to do this one must be in possession
of the Sword of Sharpness.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>“And where is that sword to be found?”
asked the Prince.</p>

<p>“On a mountain many leagues away. It is
guarded by a dragon who keeps watch over it
night and day. Only when the sun is at its
highest does the dragon sleep, and then but for
a few short minutes. To gain possession of the
sword one must ride the wild horse that lives
here in the forest and that moves faster than the
wind.”</p>

<p>“And can I find that horse and ride him?”</p>

<p>“It can be done. Under yonder rock lies a
golden bridle. It has lain hidden there for over
a hundred years. With it lies a golden whistle.
The sound of that whistle will call the horse,
wherever he is. But he is very terrible to look
upon, for his eyes are like burning coals, and he
breathes smoke and fire from his nostrils. He
will come at you as though to tear you to pieces,
but do not be afraid. Cast the bridle over his
head, and he will at once become quite tame and
gentle. Then you can ride him wheresoever you
wish. He will bear you to the mountain where
the dragon lies and will help you to gain possession
of the sword.”</p>

<p>The Prince thanked the hare for its advice.
He lifted the rock from its place, and there beneath
it lay the golden bridle and the golden
whistle. The Prince took up the bridle, and at
once the whole glade was filled with light; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
no wonder, for the bridle was studded with
precious stones and glittered like the sun. He
raised the whistle to his lips and blew upon it
loud and clear.</p>

<p>At once, from far away in the forest, came a
loud sound of neighing, and of galloping hoofs.
The wild horse was coming. On and on it came,
nearer and nearer. Its eyes shone like coals of
fire, and the leaves were withered on either side
of it because of its fiery breath.</p>

<p>It rushed at the Prince as though it would tear
him to pieces; but he was ready for it, and as
soon as it was near enough he threw the bridle
over its head. At once the fire faded from its
eyes. Its breath grew quiet, and it stood there
as gentle and harmless as a lamb.</p>

<p>“Master,” it said to Dobrotek, “I am yours
now. Whatsoever you wish me to do, I will do,
and I will bear you wherever you wish to go.”</p>

<p>“First, then,” said the Prince, “I wish you to
carry me to the mountain where I can find the
Sword of Sharpness.”</p>

<p>“Very well, Master, I will do so. But before
we start on such a dangerous adventure as that
you should be properly armed. Do you enter in
at one of my ears and go on until you come out
of the other.”</p>

<p>At once it seemed to the Prince as though the
horse’s ear were a great cave opening out before
him. He entered in and went on and on, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
it was very dark there in the horse’s head. Presently
he saw another opening before him, and that
was the horse’s other ear. He came out through it
and found himself in the forest again, but now he
was clothed as a warrior prince should be, in shining
armour, and he held a sword in his hand.</p>

<p>“That is right,” said the horse. “Now mount
and ride, for we have far to go.”</p>

<p>So the Prince said good-bye to the friendly
hare and thanked it again. He mounted upon
the horse’s back and away they went like the
wind. Soon they were out of the forest, and the
dark was left behind them. On they went and
on they went, until they came within sight of
a smoking mountain; there the horse stopped.</p>

<p>“Master,” said he, “do you see that mountain
in front of us and the smoke that rises over it?”</p>

<p>Yes, the Prince saw it.</p>

<p>“That smoke is the breath of the dragon that
guards the Sword of Sharpness. Just now he is
awake, and if we were to venture within reach
he would soon scorch us to cinders with his breath.
There are, as the hare told you, only a few short
minutes at midday when he sleeps, and when we
may approach him safely. To gain the sword I
must, in those few minutes, cross the plain
before us and climb the mountain. Only I, who
go like the wind, could do such a thing, and even
for me it will be difficult. We may both lose our
lives in the attempt.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nevertheless, we must try it,” said the Prince,
“for unless I can gain the sword, and free the
Princess from the dwarf, life is worth nothing
to me.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” answered the horse. “Then we
will attempt it, for you are my master.”</p>

<p>So all the rest of that day the horse and the
Prince lay hidden, for it was already afternoon.
Through the night and the next morning they
waited, and the Prince could see the flames and
columns of smoke that the dragon breathed forth.
But as the sun rose high in the heavens the
dragon became sleepy, and the flames burned
lower and with less smoke. At last the sun was
at its height.</p>

<p>“And now, Master, is our time,” cried the
horse. With that he galloped out on to the plain
and made for the mountain. On he flew as fast
as the wind, and faster. The Prince could hardly
breathe, and he could not see at all, so fast the
horse went. The plain was crossed, the mountain
climbed, but already the dragon was awakening.
“Quick, quick! the sword. There it lies
beside him!” cried the horse.</p>

<p>The Prince stooped and caught up the Sword of
Sharpness, and in that instant the dragon awoke.
It reared its head and seemed about to devour the
Prince, but when it saw what he held in his hand
it dropped its crest and fawned at his feet.</p>

<p>“You are my master,” it said, “for you hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the Sword of Sharpness. But do not kill me.
Spare my life, and I will give you advice that
may save your own.”</p>

<p>“What is the advice?” asked the Prince.</p>

<p>“When you reach the dwarf’s castle (for I
know that you are going there, and why), you
may with this sword be able to overcome the
dwarf. But after you have done that, you must
cut off his beard and carry it away with you.
It will serve as proof that you and you alone
have slain him. You must also fill a flask with
water from the fountain in the midst of the
garden. It is the Water of Life, and you will
need it. You will need the Cap of Invisibility
too that the dwarf sometimes wears upon his
head. All three of these things you must have.
Do not neglect what I tell you, for if you do evil
will certainly come upon you.”</p>

<p>“It is well,” said the Prince. “I will remember
what you say, and if no good comes of it, no harm
can either.”</p>

<p>So saying, the Prince drew his own sword from
its sheath and left it on the mountain, taking the
Sword of Sharpness in its place. Then he rode
down the mountain and away over the plain.
Once he looked back, but he saw neither flame
nor smoke behind him. The dragon lay there
as harmless as any worm, for with the Sword of
Sharpness all its power was gone.</p>

<p>On and on rode the Prince, so fast that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
wind was left behind, and at last he and his horse
came within sight of a castle all of iron. About
it was a wall that was seven times the height of
a man, and this also was of iron.</p>

<p>“Look, Prince,” said the horse. “That is the
dwarf’s castle that we see before us.”</p>

<p>Then on they went again and never stopped
until they reached the castle gate. Beside the
gate hung a great brazen war trumpet. The
Prince lifted it to his lips and blew upon it such a
blast that it was like to split the ears of those
who heard it. Again he blew, and once again.</p>

<p>“And now, Master, take out the sword from
its sheath and make ready, for the dwarf will
soon be here,” said the horse.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Princess Beautiful had been
living behind those iron walls, and she had been
not unhappy, though she had often grieved because
Prince Dobrotek was not with her.</p>

<p>When the dwarf had caused her to be swept
away by the hurricane he had thrown her into
an enchanted sleep, and in this sleep she lay until
she was safely placed in a room that the dwarf
had specially prepared for her. This room was
made entirely of mirrors, only divided here and
there by curtains of cloth of gold. These curtains
were embroidered with scenes from the
dwarf’s own life and from the life of the Princess.
In the mirrors Beautiful could see her own beauty
repeated endlessly. The furniture of the room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
was all of gold, curiously carved, and the cushions
were embroidered with gold and precious stones.</p>

<p>When the Princess opened her eyes and looked
about her she did not know where she was. She
had no remembrance of the storm that had
brought her hither. She remembered only that
she had stood beside Prince Dobrotek in the
church, and that a great noise had arisen outside.
After that she had known nothing until she awoke
in this chamber.</p>

<p>She arose from the couch where she was lying
and began to examine the room. All the light
came from a dome overhead. She could find
neither doors nor windows, and she wondered much
how she had been brought into a room like this.</p>

<p>While she was looking about her she heard a
noise behind her that made her turn quickly. At
one side the mirrors had swung apart like doors,
and through this opening came a procession of
enormous black slaves bearing a golden throne
in their midst. Upon this throne sat the Dwarf
with the Golden Beard. The slaves set the throne
down in the middle of the room and at once withdrew,
closing the mirrored doors behind them.</p>

<p>When the Princess saw the dwarf she was very
much alarmed. She at once suspected that it
was he who had brought her here, and that he
meant to keep her a prisoner until she would consent
to marry him.</p>

<p>The dwarf stepped down from the throne and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
approached her with a smiling air, but she shrank
away from him into the farthest corner of the
room.</p>

<p>The dwarf was magnificently dressed. His
beard had been brushed till it shone like glass,
and he had thrown it over one arm as though it
were a mantle. But in his left hand he carried
a cap of some coarse grey stuff that was in strange
contrast with the rest of his dress.</p>

<p>“Most beautiful Princess,” said he, “you are
welcome indeed in my castle. None could be
more so, and I hope to make you so happy that
you will be more than content to spend your life
here with me.”</p>

<p>“Miserable dwarf!” cried the Princess, “do
you really think you will be able to make me
stay here with you? Do you not know that
Prince Dobrotek will come in search of me soon?
He will certainly find me! Then he will punish
you as you deserve for your insolence.”</p>

<p>The Princess was trembling now, but with rage
rather than fear. The dwarf seemed not at all
disturbed by her anger, however.</p>

<p>“Beautiful one,” he said, still smiling, “you
are even more beautiful when you are angry than
when you are pleased. Let Prince Dobrotek
come. I fear him not at all. But do not let us
waste our time in talking of him. Instead let us
talk of ourselves, and of how pleasantly we will
pass our days together.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>So saying, the dwarf came close to the Princess
and attempted to take her hand. But instead of
permitting this, the Princess gave him such a
blow upon the ear that he fairly staggered under
it. His beard slipped from his arm, and in trying
to steady himself he tripped on it and fell his
length upon the floor.</p>

<p>The Princess laughed maliciously. At the
sound of her laughter the dwarf became filled
with fury. His eyes flashed fire as he scrambled
to his feet. “Miserable girl!” he cried. “Do
you dare to laugh? The time will come when
you will feel more like weeping, if not for me
then for yourself. Some day you will be glad
enough to receive my caresses. Now I will leave
you, and when I come again it will be in a different
manner.” So saying, he gathered up his beard
and rushed through the mirror door, closing it
behind him.</p>

<p>His words, and his manner of going, frightened
the Princess. She again began to look about her
for some way of escape. Suddenly she saw upon
the floor the grey cap that the dwarf had carried
in his hand. He must have dropped it when he
fell, and he had been too angry to notice that he
was leaving it behind. She picked it up and
stood turning it thoughtfully in her hands. Then,
without considering why she did so, she placed
it upon her head. She was standing directly in
front of a mirror at the time. To her amazement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
the moment she had the cap on her head
every reflection of her vanished from every mirror
in the room. The Princess could hardly believe
her eyes. She might have been thin air for any
impression she made upon the glass. She took
the cap from her head, and immediately her
reflections appeared again in the mirrors. She
replaced it, and they vanished from sight. Then
the Princess knew that she held the Cap of
Invisibility—the cap that causes anyone who
wears it to become invisible.</p>

<p>As she stood there with the cap still upon her
head, the mirror door was burst open and the
dwarf rushed into the room. His dress was disordered
and his eyes glared wildly.</p>

<p>He looked hastily about him, but he could see
neither the cap nor the Princess. At once he
knew that she had found the cap and had put
it on.</p>

<p>“Ah, ha!” he cried to the invisible Princess.
“So you have found it! You have put it on,
and hope so to escape me. But I know you are
still here, even though I cannot see you. I will
find you, never fear.”</p>

<p>Spreading his arms wide, he rushed about the
room, hoping to touch the Princess and seize her,
but as he could not see her she was easily able
to escape him. Now and then he stopped and
listened, hoping the Princess would make some
sound that would tell him where she was, but at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
these times Beautiful too stood still. She did not
move, she scarcely breathed, lest he should hear
her.</p>

<p>Suddenly the Princess saw something that gave
her a hope of escape. The dwarf had neglected
to fasten the swinging mirror behind him when
he entered. She flew to it and pushed it open.
Beyond lay a long corridor. Down this the
Princess fled, not knowing where it would lead
her.</p>

<p>But the dwarf saw the mirror move, and guessed
she had passed out through it. With a cry of
rage he sprang after her.</p>

<p>At the end of the corridor was a barred door.
Beautiful had scarcely time to unfasten this door
and run through before the dwarf reached it.
But once outside the door she found herself in a
wide and open garden. Here she could pause
and take breath. The dwarf had no means of
knowing in which direction she had gone. He
could not hear her footsteps upon the soft grass,
and the rustling of the wind among the leaves
prevented his hearing the sound of her dress as
she moved.</p>

<p>For a while the dwarf ran up and down the
garden, hoping some accident might bring him to
the Princess. But he grasped nothing except
empty air. Discouraged, he turned back to the
castle at last, muttering threats as he went.</p>

<p>After he had gone the Princess began to look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
about her. She found the garden very beautiful.
There were winding paths and fountains and
fruit trees and pergolas where she could rest
when she was weary. She tasted the fruit and
found it delicious. It seemed to her she could
live there for ever very happily, if only her dear
Prince Dobrotek were with her.</p>

<p>As for the dwarf, in the days that followed
the Princess quite lost her fear of him, though
he often came to the garden in search of her.
After a time she even amused herself by teasing
him. She would take off her cap and allow him
to see her. Then, as he rushed toward her, she
would put it on again and vanish from his sight.
Or she would run just in front of him, singing
as she went, that he might know where she was.
The poor dwarf would chase madly after the
sound. Then, when it seemed that he was just
about to catch her, she would suddenly become
silent and step aside on the grass, and laugh to
herself to see him run past her, grasping at the air.</p>

<p>But this was a dangerous game for the Princess
to play; she was not always to escape so easily.
One day she was running before him, just out of
reach, and calling to him to follow, when a low
branch caught her cap and brushed it from her
head. Immediately she became visible.</p>

<p>With a cry of triumph the dwarf caught the
cap as it fell and thrust it in his bosom. Then
he seized the Princess by the wrist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have you now, my pretty bird. No use to
struggle. You shall not escape again.”</p>

<p>In despair the Princess tried to tear herself
loose from his hold, but the dwarf’s fingers were
like iron.</p>

<p>At this moment from outside the gate sounded
the loud blast of a war trumpet. At once the
dwarf guessed that it was Prince Dobrotek who
blew it, and that he had come in search of the
Princess.</p>

<p>Suddenly, and before Beautiful could hinder
him, he drew her to him and breathed upon her
eyelids; at the same time he muttered the words
of a magic charm.</p>

<p>At once the Princess felt her senses leaving her.
In vain she strove to move or speak. In spite of
herself her eyes closed, and she sank softly to
the ground in a deep sleep.</p>

<p>As soon as the dwarf saw that his charm had
worked he caused a dark cloud to gather about
him, which entirely hid him from view. Rising
in this cloud, he floated high above the iron walls
and paused directly over Prince Dobrotek. He
drew his sword and made ready to slay the bold
Prince who had come against him.</p>

<p>Dobrotek looked up and wondered to see the
dark cloud that had so suddenly gathered above
him.</p>

<p>“Beware!” cried the wild horse loudly. “It
is the dwarf. He is about to strike.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>Scarcely had he spoken when the darkness drew
down about them. Through this darkness shot
a flash as bright as lightning. It was the dwarf’s
sword that had struck at the Prince. But swift
as the stroke was, the horse was no less swift.
He sprang aside, and the sword drove so deep
into the earth that the dwarf was not able to
draw it out again.</p>

<p>“Strike! Strike!” cried the horse to Dobrotek.
“It is your chance!”</p>

<p>Dobrotek raised the Sword of Sharpness and
struck into the cloud, and his blow was so sharp
and true that the dwarf’s head was cut from his
body and fell at the Prince’s feet.</p>

<p>Dobrotek alighted, and cutting off the dwarf’s
beard, he wound it about him like a glittering
golden belt. Then, leaving the head where it lay,
he opened the gate and went into the garden.</p>

<p>He had not far to go in his search for Beautiful,
for she was lying asleep upon the grass close to
the gate. Dobrotek was filled with joy at the
sight.</p>

<p>“Princess, awake! awake!” he cried. “It is
I, Dobrotek. I have come to rescue you.”</p>

<p>The Princess neither stirred nor woke. Her
lashes rested on her cheeks, and she breathed so
gently that her breast scarcely moved.</p>

<p>“Master,” said the horse, “this is no natural
sleep. It is some enchantment. Take up that
cap that lies beside her. Then fill your flask at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
the fountain of the Water of Life and let us go.
Do not try to wake her now. When it is time,
you can do so by sprinkling upon her a few drops
of the water. But first let us make haste to leave
this place, for it is still full of evil magic.”</p>

<p>Dobrotek was not slow to do as the horse bade
him. He filled a flask with the Water of Life
and hid the Cap of Invisibility in his bosom.
Then, lifting the Princess in his arms, he mounted
the horse and rode back with her the way they
had come.</p>

<p>It was not long before they reached the place
where the Prince had saved the hare from the
owl in the forest. Here the Prince found his own
horse. It had not wandered away, but had
stayed there, browsing on the grass and leaves
and drinking from a stream near by.</p>

<p>“And now, Prince,” said the wild steed, “it is
time for us to part. Light down and take the
bridle from my head. Put it back again where
you found it, and cover it with the rock; but
keep the whistle by you. If ever you need me,
blow upon it, and I will come to your aid.”</p>

<p>Dobrotek did as the steed bade him. He
lighted down and took the bridle from its head.
He put it in the hole where he had found it and
rolled back the rock upon it. Then the horse
bade him farewell, and tore away through the
forest, neighing as it went and breathing flames
of fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>After it had gone the Prince felt very weary.
He had not yet awakened the Princess, but had
laid her, still asleep, upon the soft moss of the
forest. Now he stretched himself at her feet, and
at once fell into a deep slumber.</p>

<p>Now it so chanced that while he was asleep
King Sarudine, the King of the Black Country,
came riding through the forest. He too had
been a suitor for the hand of the Princess, but
he had been refused. When he heard that she
had been spirited away, and that Prince Dobrotek
had gone to seek for her, he also determined to
set out on the same mission. He hoped that he
might be the first to find her and so win her for
his bride. For the King, her father, had sent
out a proclamation that whoever could find the
Princess Beautiful and rescue her should have
her for his wife.</p>

<p>What was the amazement of Sarudine, as he
came through the lonely wood, suddenly to see
the Princess lying there asleep, with Dobrotek at
her feet.</p>

<p>At first he drew his sword, thinking to kill the
Prince; but after a moment’s thought he put
it back in its sheath. Then bending over Beautiful
he very quietly lifted her in his arms, mounted
his horse, and rode away with her.</p>

<p>Dobrotek was so wearied with his adventures
that he slept on for some time, not knowing that
the Princess had again been stolen from him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>But when at last he woke and found her gone,
he was like one mad, so great was his despair.
He rushed about hither and thither through the
forest, calling her name aloud, and seeking her
everywhere, but nowhere could he find her.</p>

<p>Suddenly he bethought him of his golden
whistle, and putting it to his lips he blew so loud
and shrill that the forest echoed to the sound.
At once the great grey horse came galloping
through the forest to him.</p>

<p>Dobrotek ran to meet it. “Tell me,” he cried,
“you who know all things, where is Beautiful?
She has been stolen from me, and I cannot find
her.”</p>

<p>“She is no longer here in the forest,” answered
the horse. “She has been carried away by King
Sarudine. He has taken her back to her father’s
castle, and now he claims her as his bride, for
he says that he is the one who found and rescued
her. But she still sleeps her enchanted sleep,
and none can waken her. You alone can do
this, for you have the Waters of Life. Hasten
back to the castle, therefore, but before you go
to waken her, put on the Cap of Invisibility.
King Sarudine fears you, and he has set guards
about the castle with orders to slay you if you
attempt to enter. All their watchfulness will
be in vain, however, if you wear the cap upon
your head.”</p>

<p>The advice was wise, and Dobrotek at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
did as the horse told him. He drew out the
cap and put it upon his head. So he became
invisible. Then he rode away in the direction
of the country of the Silver Mountains.</p>

<p>He rode on and on, and after a while he came
to where the first line of guards was set. They
heard the galloping of a horse, and looked all
about them, but they could see no one, so he
passed in safety. Not long after he came to a
second line of soldiers, and he went by them
unseen also. Then he passed a third line of
guards, and after that he was at the palace.</p>

<p>The Prince entered in, and went from one room
to another, and presently he came to the great
audience hall. There sat the King upon a golden
throne. At his right hand sat King Sarudine,
and at his left the Princess lay upon a golden
couch, and so beautiful she looked as she lay
asleep that the Prince’s heart melted within
him for love. He lifted the cap from his head,
and there they all saw him standing before
them.</p>

<p>The King of the Black Mountains turned pale
and trembled at the sight of him, but the old
King gave a loud cry of surprise. He had thought
that Prince Dobrotek had met his death long
ago, or that if he lived he would be afraid to
return to the Silver Mountain Country without
bringing the Princess with him.</p>

<p>“Rash Prince!” he cried; “what are you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
doing here? Do you not fear to appear before
me, having failed in your search?”</p>

<p>“I did not fail,” answered the Prince, “there
lies the Princess, and were it not for me she
would still be a prisoner in the castle of the
Dwarf of the Golden Beard.”</p>

<p>“How is that?” asked the King.</p>

<p>Then Dobrotek told them his story. He told
of how he had become master of the wild horse
in the forest, of how he had gained possession
of the Sword of Sharpness, and then of how he
had ridden to the dwarf’s castle and slain him
in battle. He also told how he had brought
the Princess away with him, how he had fallen
asleep in the forest, and of how the King of the
Black Country had stolen Beautiful from him
while he slept.</p>

<p>The old King listened attentively to all that
Dobrotek told him. When the Prince had made
an end to his story the old King turned to King
Sarudine beside him.</p>

<p>“And what have you to say to this?” he
asked. “Is this story true?”</p>

<p>“Much of it is true,” answered Sarudine,
hardily, “but still more of it is false. It is true
that it was the dwarf who carried Beautiful
away. It is true that he kept her a prisoner,
and that he was slain by the Sword of Sharpness.
But it was I who won the sword and slew the
dwarf, and it was I who rescued the Princess.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
What better proof of this is needed than that
it was I who brought her here?”</p>

<p>“That is only proof that you stole her from
me,” cried the Prince. “The proof that I can
offer is better still. If you slew the dwarf, where
is his beard?”</p>

<p>To this the King of the Black Country could
answer nothing, for he did not know where the
beard was.</p>

<p>“Then I can tell you,” cried the Prince.
With these words he threw aside his mantle,
and there, wound about him like a glittering
girdle, was the golden beard of the dwarf.</p>

<p>When the old King saw the beard he could
doubt no longer as to which of the two had slain
the dwarf and rescued the Princess. He turned
such a terrible look upon Sarudine that the
young King trembled.</p>

<p>“So you would have deceived me!” he cried.
“You thought to win the Princess by a trick.
Away! Away with you! Let me never see
your face again; and if ever again you venture
into my country, you shall be thrown into a
dungeon and remain there as long as you live.”</p>

<p>Then, as Sarudine was hurried away by the
guards, the old King turned again to the Prince.
“You have indeed rescued the Princess,” he
said, “but your task is still only half completed.
She sleeps, and none can wake her. Until that
is done, no man can have her for wife.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>“That is not such a hard matter, either,”
said the Prince. With that he drew from his
bosom the flask that held the Waters of Life and
scattered a few drops upon the Princess.</p>

<p>At once she drew a deep breath and slowly
opened her eyes. As soon as she saw the Prince
she sprang to her feet and threw herself into his
arms. The enchantment was broken, and she
had awakened at last.</p>

<p>Then throughout the palace there was the
greatest happiness and rejoicing. There never
had been anything like the favours the old King
heaped upon Dobrotek. The marriage between
him and the Princess was again prepared for,
and this time all went well. Nothing happened
to interfere with the wedding, and the Prince
and Beautiful were made man and wife. They
loved each other all the more tenderly for the
dangers they had shared, and from that time
on they lived in all the happiness that true love
brings.</p>

<h2>THE GREAT WHITE BEAR AND THE
TROLLS<br />

<small>A STORY FROM THE NORSE</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>THERE was once a man in Finmark
named Halvor, who had a great white
bear, and this great white bear knew
many tricks. One day the man thought to
himself, “This bear is very wonderful. I will
take it as a present to the King of Denmark,
and perhaps he will give me in return a whole
bag of money.” So he set out along the road
to Denmark, leading the bear behind him.</p>

<p>He journeyed on and journeyed on, and after
a while he came to a deep, dark forest. There
was no house in sight, and as it was almost night
Halvor began to be afraid he would have to sleep
on the ground, with only the trees overhead for
a shelter.</p>

<p>Presently, however, he heard the sound of a
woodcutter’s axe. He followed the sound, and
soon he came to an opening in the forest. There,
sure enough, was a man hard at work cutting
down trees. “And wherever there’s a man,”
thought Halvor to himself, “there must be a
house for him to live in.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good day,” said Halvor.</p>

<p>“Good day!” answered the man, staring with
all his eyes at the great white bear.</p>

<p>“Will you give us shelter for the night, my bear
and me?” asked Halvor. “And will you give us
a bit of food too? I will pay you well if you will.”</p>

<p>“Gladly would I give you both food and
shelter,” answered the man, “but to-night, of
all nights in the year, no one may stop in my
home except at the risk of his life.”</p>

<p>“How is that?” asked Halvor; and he was
very much surprised.</p>

<p>“Why, it is this way. This is the eve of St John,
and on every St John’s Eve all the trolls in the
forest come to my house. I am obliged to spread
a feast for them, and there they stay all night,
eating and drinking. If they found anyone in the
house at that time, they would surely tear him to
pieces. Even I and my wife dare not stay. We
are obliged to spend the night in the forest.”</p>

<p>“This is a strange business,” said Halvor.
“Nevertheless, I have a mind to stop there and see
what these same trolls look like. As to their hurting
me, as long as I have my bear with me there is
nothing in the world that I am afraid of.”</p>

<p>The woodcutter was alarmed at these words.
“No, no; do not risk it, I beg of you!” he cried.
“Do you spend the night with us out under the trees,
and to-morrow we can safely return to our home.”</p>

<p>But Halvor would not listen to this. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
determined to sleep in a house that night, and,
moreover, he had a great curiosity to see what
trolls looked like.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the woodcutter at last,
“since you are determined to risk your life, do
you follow yonder path, and it will soon bring
you to my house.”</p>

<p>Halvor thanked him and went on his way,
and it was not long before he and his bear reached
the woodcutter’s home. He opened the door and
went in, and when he saw the feast the woodcutter
had spread for the trolls his mouth fairly
watered to taste of it. There were sausages and
ale and fish and cakes and rice porridge and all
sorts of good things. He tasted a bit here and
there and gave his bear some, and then he sat
down to wait for the coming of the trolls. As
for the bear, he lay down beside his master and
went to sleep.</p>

<p>They had not been there long when a great
noise arose in the forest outside. It was a sound
of moaning and groaning and whistling and shrieking.
So loud and terrible it grew that Halvor was
frightened in spite of himself. The cold crept up
and down his back and the hair rose on his head.
The sound came nearer and nearer, and by the
time it reached the door Halvor was so frightened
that he could bear it no longer. He jumped up
and ran to the stove. Quickly he opened the
oven door and hid himself inside, pulling the door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
to behind him. The great white bear paid no
attention, however, but only snored in his sleep.</p>

<p>Scarcely was Halvor inside the oven when the
door of the house was burst open and all the trolls
of the forest came pouring into the room.</p>

<p>There were big trolls and little trolls, fat trolls
and thin. Some had long tails and some had short
tails and some had no tails at all. Some had two
eyes and some had three, and some had only one
set in the middle of the forehead. One there was,
and the others called him Long Nose, who had a
nose as long and as thin as a poker.</p>

<p>The trolls banged the door behind them, and
then they gathered round the table where the
feast was spread.</p>

<p>“What is this?” cried the biggest troll in a
terrible voice (and Halvor’s heart trembled within
him). “Some one has been here before us. The
food has been tasted and ale has been spilled.”</p>

<p>At once Long Nose began snuffing about.
“Whoever has been here is here still,” he cried.
“Let us find him and tear him to pieces.”</p>

<p>“Here is his pussy-cat, anyway,” cried the
smallest troll of all, pointing to the white bear.
“Oh, what a pretty cat it is! Pussy! Pussy!
Pussy!” And the little troll put a piece of
sausage on a fork and stuck it against the white
bear’s nose.</p>

<p>At that the great white bear gave a roar and
rose to its feet. It gave the troll a blow with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
its paw that sent him spinning across the room.
He of the long nose had it almost broken off,
and the big troll’s ears rang with the box he
got. This way and that the trolls were knocked
and beaten by the bear, until at last they tore
the door open and fled away into the forest,
howling.</p>

<p>When they had all gone Halvor crawled out
and closed the door, and then he and the white
bear sat down and feasted to their hearts’ content.
After that the two of them lay down and
slept quietly for the rest of the night.</p>

<p>In the morning the woodcutter and his family
stole back to the house and peeped in at the
window. What was their surprise to see Halvor
and his bear sitting there and eating their breakfasts
as though nothing in the world had happened
to them.</p>

<p>“How is this?” cried the woodcutter. “Did
the trolls not come?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, they came,” answered Halvor, “but
we drove them away, and I do not think they
will trouble you again.” He then told the woodcutter
all that had happened in the night. “After
the beating they received, they will be in no hurry
to visit you again,” he said.</p>

<p>The woodcutter was filled with joy and gratitude
when he heard this. He and his wife entreated
Halvor to stay there in the forest and
make his home with them, but this he refused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
to do. He was on his way to Denmark to sell
his bear to the King, and to Denmark he would
go. So off he set, after saying good-bye, and
the good wishes of the woodcutter and his wife
went with him.</p>

<p>Now the very next year, on St John’s Eve,
the woodcutter was out in the forest cutting
wood, when a great ugly troll stuck his head out
of a tree near by.</p>

<p>“Woodcutter! Woodcutter!” he cried.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the woodcutter, “what is it?”</p>

<p>“Tell me, have you that great white cat with
you still?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have; and, moreover, now she has
five kittens, and each one of them is larger and
stronger than she is.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” cried the troll, in a great fright.
“Then good-bye, woodcutter, for we will never
come to your house again.”</p>

<p>Then he drew in his head and the tree closed
together, and that was the last the woodcutter
heard or saw of the trolls. After that he and his
family lived undisturbed and unafraid.</p>

<p>As for Halvor, he had already reached Denmark,
and the King had been so pleased with
the bear that he paid a whole bag of money for
it, just as Halvor had hoped, and with that bag of
money Halvor set up in trade so successfully that
he became one of the richest men in Denmark.</p>

<h2>THE STORY OF THE THREE BILLY
GOAT GRUFFS<br />

<small>A STORY FROM THE NORSE</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>THERE were once three Billy Goats who
lived in a meadow at the foot of a mountain,
and their last name was Gruff.
There was the Big Billy Goat Gruff, and the
Middle-sized Billy Goat Gruff, and the Little
Billy Goat Gruff. They all three jumped about
among the rocks in the meadow and ate what
grass they could find, but it wasn’t very much.</p>

<p>One day the Littlest Billy Goat Gruff looked
up at the high mountain overhead, and he
thought to himself, “It looks as though there
were a great deal of fine grass up on the mountain.
I believe I’ll just run up there all by
myself, without telling anyone, and eat so much grass
and eat so much grass that I’ll grow to be
as big as anybody.”</p>

<p>So off the Little Billy Goat Gruff started
without telling his brothers a word about it.
He ran along, tip-tap, tip-tap, tip-tap, until
at last he came to a wide river, with a bridge
over it.</p>

<p>Now the Little Billy Goat did not know it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
but this bridge belonged to a great, terrible
Troll, and the little goat had not gone more
than half-way across when he heard the Troll
shouting from under the bridge.</p>

<p>“Who’s that going across my bridge?” shouted
the Troll in his great loud voice.</p>

<p>“It’s me, the Littlest Billy Goat Gruff!”
answered the Little Billy Goat in his little bit
of voice.</p>

<p>“Oh! it’s the Littlest Billy Goat Gruff, is it?
Well, you won’t go much farther, for I’m the
Troll that owns this bridge, and now I’m coming
to eat you up.” And with that the Troll looked
up over the edge of the bridge.</p>

<p>When the Little Billy Goat Gruff saw him,
he was very much frightened. “Oh, dear, good
Mr Troll, please don’t eat me up,” he cried.
“I’m such a very little goat that I would scarcely
be a mouthful for you. I have a brother who
is a great deal bigger than I am; wait till he
comes, for he’d make a much better meal for
you than I would.”</p>

<p>“But if he’s much bigger than you are he may
be tough.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, he’s just as tender as I am.”</p>

<p>“And a great deal bigger?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, a great deal bigger.”</p>

<p>“Very well then, I’ll wait for him. Run
along!”</p>

<p>So the little goat ran on, tip-tap! tip-tap!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
tip-tap! across the bridge, and on up the mountain
to where he was safe. And glad enough
he was to be out of that scrape, I can tell you.</p>

<p>Now it was not very long after this that the
Middle-sized Billy Goat Gruff began to think
he’d like to go up on the mountain too. He
did not say anything about it to the Great Big
Billy Goat Gruff, but off he set, all by himself—trap-trap!
trap-trap! trap-trap! After a while
he came to the bridge, where the Troll lived,
and he stepped out upon it, trap-trap! trap-trap!
trap-trap!</p>

<p>He’d barely reached the middle of it when
the Troll began shouting at him in his great,
terrible voice:</p>

<p>“Who’s that going across my bridge?”</p>

<p>“It’s me, the Middle-sized Billy Goat Gruff,”
answered the Middle-sized Billy Goat in his
middle-sized voice.</p>

<p>“Oh, it is, is it? Then you’re the very one
I’ve been waiting for. I’m the Troll that owns
this bridge, and now I’m coming to eat you up.”</p>

<p>At that the Middle-sized Billy Goat Gruff was
in a great fright. “Oh, dear Mr Troll, good
Mr Troll, please don’t eat me up! I have a
brother that’s a great deal bigger than I am.
Just wait till he comes along, for he’d make a
much better meal for you than I would.”</p>

<p>“A great deal bigger?”</p>

<p>“Yes, a great deal bigger.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>“Very well then, run along and I’ll wait till he
comes. Only the biggest goat there is is fit to
make a meal for me.”</p>

<p>The Middle-sized Billy Goat was not slow to
run along as the Troll bade him. He hurried
across the river and up the mountain as fast
as he could go, trappity-trap! trappity-trap!
trappity-trap! And just weren’t he and his little
brother glad to see each other again, and to be
safely over the Troll’s bridge, and up where the
good grass was!</p>

<p>And now it was the turn of the Big Billy Goat
Gruff to begin to think he’d like to go up on
the mountain too. “I believe that’s where the
Little Billy Goat Gruff and the Middle-sized
Billy Goat Gruff have gone,” said he to himself.
“If I don’t look out they’ll be growing so fat
up there that they’ll be as big as I am. I think
I’d better go and eat the long green mountain
grass too.” So the next morning off he
set in the pleasant sunshine. Klumph-klumph!
klumph-klumph! He was so big you could hear
his hoofs pounding on the stones while he was
still a mile away.</p>

<p>After a while he came to the bridge where
the Troll lived, and out he stepped on it, klumph-klumph!
klumph-klumph! and the bridge shook
and bent under his weight as he walked. Then
the Troll that lived under it was in a fearful rage.
“Who’s that going across my bridge?” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
bellowed, and his voice was so terrible that all
the little fish in the river swam away and hid
under the rocks at the sound of it.</p>

<p>But the Big Billy Goat was not one bit
frightened.</p>

<p>“It’s me, the Biggest Billy Goat Gruff,” he
answered, in a voice as big as the Troll’s own.</p>

<p>“Oh, it is, is it? Then just stop a bit—for
you’re the one I’ve been waiting for. I’m the
Troll that owns this bridge, and now I’m coming
to eat you up!” and with that the great grey
Troll poked his head up over the bridge, and
his eyes looked like two great mill-wheels, and
they were going round and round in his head with
rage. But still the Big Billy Goat was not one
bit frightened.</p>

<p>“So you’re a Troll, are you! And you own
this bridge, do you? And now you’re going to
eat me up? We’ll just see about that:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“I have a forehead as hard as stone,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And I’ll mash you all up, body and bone!”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>When the Troll heard the Big Billy Goat talk
to him that way he bellowed so that the Middle-sized
Billy Goat and the Little Billy Goat heard
him all the way up on the mountain where they
were. He jumped up on the bridge and put
down his big, bushy head and ran at the Billy
Goat, and the Big Billy Goat put down his head
and ran at the Troll, and they met in the middle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
of the bridge. But the Billy Goat’s head was
harder than the Troll’s, so he knocked him down
and thumped him about, and then he took him
up on his horns and threw him over the edge of
the bridge into the river below, and the Troll
sank like a piece of lead and never was seen or
heard of again.</p>

<p>But the Big Billy Goat went on up the mountain;
and you may believe that his two brothers
were glad to see him again, and to hear that the
great wicked Troll was gone from under the
bridge.</p>

<p>And after that they all stayed up on the mountain
together, and the smaller goats ate so much
grass and grew so fat and big that after a while
no one could have told one Billy Goat from the
other.</p>

<h2>THE STONES OF PLOUVINEC<br />

<small>A TALE FROM BRITTANY</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>IN the little village of Plouvinec there once
lived a poor stone-cutter named Bernet.</p>

<p>Bernet was an honest and industrious young
man, and yet he never seemed to succeed in the
world. Work as he might, he was always poor.
This was a great grief to him, for he was in love
with the beautiful Madeleine Pornec, and she was
the daughter of the richest man in Plouvinec.</p>

<p>Madeleine had many suitors, but she cared for
none of them except Bernet. She would gladly
have married him in spite of his poverty, but
her father was covetous as well as rich. He had
no wish for a poor son-in-law, and Madeleine was
so beautiful he expected her to marry some rich
merchant, or a well-to-do farmer at least. But
if Madeleine could not have Bernet for a husband,
she was determined that she would have no one.</p>

<p>There came a winter when Bernet found himself
poorer than he had ever been before. Scarcely anyone
seemed to have any need for a stone-cutter, and
even for such work as he did get he was poorly
paid. He learned to know what it meant to go
without a meal and to be cold as well as hungry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>As Christmas drew near, the landlord of the
inn at Plouvinec decided to give a feast for all
the good folk of the village, and Bernet was
invited along with all the rest.</p>

<p>He was glad enough to go to the feast, for he
knew that Madeleine was to be there, and even
if he did not have a chance to talk to her, he
could at least look at her, and that would be
better than nothing.</p>

<p>The feast was a fine one. There was plenty to
eat and drink, and all was of the best, and the
more the guests feasted, the merrier they grew.
If Bernet and Madeleine ate little and spoke less,
no one noticed it. People were too busy filling
their own stomachs and laughing at the jokes
that were cracked. The fun was at its height
when the door was pushed open, and a ragged, ill-looking
beggar slipped into the room.</p>

<p>At the sight of him the laughter and merriment
died away. This beggar was well known to all
the people of the village, though none knew
whence he came nor where he went when he was
away on his wanderings. He was sly and crafty,
and he was feared as well as disliked, for it was
said that he had the evil eye. Whether he had
or not, it was well known that no one had ever
offended him without having some misfortune
happen soon after.</p>

<p>“I heard there was a great feast here to-night,”
said the beggar in a humble voice, “and that all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the village had been bidden to it. Perhaps, when
all have eaten, there may be some scraps that I
might pick up.”</p>

<p>“Scraps there are in plenty,” answered the
landlord, “but it is not scraps that I am offering
to anyone to-night. Draw up a chair to the
table, and eat and drink what you will. There
is more than enough for all.” But the landlord
looked none too well pleased as he spoke. It was
a piece of ill-luck to have the beggar come to his
house this night of all nights, to spoil the pleasure
of the guests.</p>

<p>The beggar drew up to the table as the landlord
bade him, but the fun and merriment were
ended. Presently the guests began to leave the
table, and after thanking their host, they went
away to their own homes.</p>

<p>When the beggar had eaten and drunk to his
heart’s content, he pushed back his chair from
the table.</p>

<p>“I have eaten well,” said he to the landlord.
“Is there not now some corner where I can spend
the night?”</p>

<p>“There is the stable,” answered the landlord
grudgingly. “Every room in the house is full,
but if you choose to sleep there among the clean
hay, I am not the one to say you nay.”</p>

<p>Well, the beggar was well content with that.
He went out to the stable, and there he snuggled
down among the soft hay, and soon he was fast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
asleep. He had slept for some hours, and it was
midnight, when he suddenly awoke with a startled
feeling that he was not alone in the stable. In
the darkness two strange voices were talking
together.</p>

<p>“Well, brother, how goes it since last Christmas?”
asked one voice.</p>

<p>“Poorly, brother, but poorly,” answered the
other. “Methinks the work has been heavier
these last twelve months than ever before.”</p>

<p>The beggar, listening as he lay in the hay,
wondered who could be talking there at this hour
of the night. Then he discovered that the voices
came from the stalls near by; the ox and the
donkey were talking together.</p>

<p>The beggar was so surprised that he almost
exclaimed aloud, but he restrained himself. He
remembered a story he had often heard, but had
never before believed, that on every Christmas
night it is given to the dumb beasts in the stalls
to talk in human tones for a short time. It was
said that those who had been lucky enough to
hear them at such times had sometimes learned
strange secrets from their talk. Now the beggar
lay listening with all his ears, and scarcely daring
to breathe lest he should disturb them.</p>

<p>“It has been a hard year for me too,” said
the ox, answering what the donkey had just
said. “I would our master had some of the
treasure that lies hidden under the stones of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Plouvinec. Then he could buy more oxen and
more donkeys, and the work would be easier
for us.”</p>

<p>“The treasure! What treasure is that?”
asked the donkey.</p>

<p>The ox seemed very much surprised. “Have
you never heard? I thought every one knew of
the hidden treasure under the stones.”</p>

<p>“Tell me about it,” said the donkey, “for I
dearly love a tale.”</p>

<p>The ox was not loath to do this. At once it
began:</p>

<p>“You know the barren heath just outside of
Plouvinec, and the great stones that lie there,
each so large that it would take more than a team
of oxen to drag it from its place?”</p>

<p>Yes, the donkey knew that heath, and the
stones too. He had often passed by them on his
journeys to the neighbouring town.</p>

<p>“It is said that under those stones lies hidden
an enormous treasure of gold,” said the ox.
“That is the story; it is well known. But none
has seen that treasure; jealously the stones
guard it. Once in every hundred years, however,
the stones go down to the river to drink. They
are only away for a few minutes; then they
come rolling back in mad haste to cover their
gold again. But if anyone could be there on the
heath for those few minutes, it is a wonderful
sight that he would see while the stones are away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
It is now a hundred years, all but a week, since
the stones went down to drink.”</p>

<p>“Then a week from to-night the treasure will
be uncovered again?” asked the donkey.</p>

<p>“Yes, exactly a week from now, at midnight.”</p>

<p>“Ah, if only our master knew this,” and the
donkey sighed heavily. “If only we could tell
him! Then he might go to the heath and not
only see the treasure, but gather a sack full of
it for himself.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but even if he did, he would never return
with it alive. As I told you, the stones are very
jealous of their treasure, and are away for only
a few minutes. By the time he had gathered up
the gold and was ready to escape, the stones
would return and would crush him to powder.”</p>

<p>The beggar, who had become very much excited
at the story, felt a cold shiver creep over him at
these words.</p>

<p>“No one could ever bring away any of it then?”
asked the donkey.</p>

<p>“I did not say that. The stones are enchanted.
If anyone could find a five-leaved clover, and
carry it with him to the heath, the stones could
not harm him, for the five-leaved clover is a magic
plant that has power over all enchanted things,
and those stones are enchanted.”</p>

<p>“Then all he would need would be to have a
five-leaved clover.”</p>

<p>“If he carried that with him, the stones could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
not harm him. He might escape safely with the
treasure, but it would do him little good. With
the first rays of the sun the treasure would
crumble away unless the life of a human being
had been sacrificed to the stones there on the
heath before sunrise.”</p>

<p>“And who would sacrifice a human life for a
treasure!” cried the donkey. “Not our master,
I am sure.”</p>

<p>The ox made no answer, and now the donkey
too was silent. The hour had passed in which
they could speak in human voices. For another
year they would again be only dumb brutes.</p>

<p>As for the beggar, he lay among the hay, shaking
all over with excitement. Visions of untold
wealth shone before his eyes. The treasure of
Plouvinec! Why, if he could only get it, he
would be the richest man in the village. In the
village? No, in the country—in the whole world!
Only to see it and handle it for a few hours would
be something. But before even that were possible
and safe it would be necessary to find a five-leaved
clover.</p>

<p>With the earliest peep of dawn the beggar
rolled from the hay, and, wrapping his rags
about him, stole out of the stable and away into
the country. There he began looking about for
bunches of clover. These were not hard to find;
they were everywhere, though the most of them
were withered now. He found and examined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
clump after clump. Here and there he found a
stem that bore four leaves, but none had five.
Night came on, and the darkness made him give
up the search; but the next day he began anew.
Again he was unsuccessful. So day after day
passed by, and still he had not found the thing
he sought so eagerly.</p>

<p>The beggar was in a fever of rage and disappointment.
Six days slipped by. By the time
the seventh dawned he was so discouraged that
he hunted for only a few hours. Then, though it
was still daylight, he determined to give up the
search. With drooping head he turned back
toward the village. As he was passing a heap of
rocks he noticed a clump of clover growing in
a crevice. Idly, and with no hope of success, he
stooped and began to examine it leaf by leaf.</p>

<p>Suddenly he gave a cry of joy. His legs
trembled under him so that he was obliged to
sink to his knees. The last stem of all bore five
leaves. He had found his five-leaved clover!</p>

<p>With the magic plant safely hidden away in
his bosom the beggar hurried back toward the
village. He would rest in the inn until night.
Then he would go to the heath, and if the story
the ox had told were true, he would see a sight
such as no one living had ever seen before.</p>

<p>His way led him past the heath. Dusk was
falling as he approached it. Suddenly the beggar
paused and listened. From among the stones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
sounded a strange tap-tapping. Cautiously he
drew nearer, peering about among the stones.
Then he saw what seemed to him a curious sight
for such a place and such a time. Before the
largest stone of all stood Bernet, busily at work
with hammer and chisel. He was cutting a cross
upon the face of the rock.</p>

<p>The beggar drew near to him so quietly that
Bernet did not notice him. He started as a voice
suddenly spoke close to his ear.</p>

<p>“That is a strange thing for you to be doing,”
said the beggar. “Why should you waste your
time in cutting a cross in such a lonely place as
this?”</p>

<p>“The sign of the cross never comes amiss,
wherever it may be,” answered Bernet. “And
as for wasting my time, no one seems to have
any use for it at present. It is better for me to
spend it in this way than to idle it away over
nothing.”</p>

<p>Suddenly a strange idea flashed into the beggar’s
mind—a thought so strange and terrible that it
made him turn pale. He drew nearer to the
stone-cutter and laid his hand upon his arm.</p>

<p>“Listen, Bernet,” said he; “you are a clever
workman and an honest one as well, and yet all
your work scarcely brings you in enough to live
on. Suppose I were to tell you that in one night
you might become rich—richer than the richest
man in the village—so that there would be no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
desire that you could not satisfy; what would
you think of that?”</p>

<p>“I would think nothing of it, for I would know
it was not true,” answered Bernet carelessly.</p>

<p>“But it <i>is</i> true; it is <i>true</i>, I tell you,” cried
the beggar. “Listen, and I will tell you.”</p>

<p>He drew still nearer to Bernet, so that his
mouth almost touched the stone-cutter’s ear, and
in a whisper he repeated to him the story he
had heard the ox telling the donkey—the story of
the treasure that was buried under the stones of
Plouvinec. But it was only a part of the story
that he told after all, for he did not tell Bernet
that anyone who was rash enough to seek the
treasure would be crushed by the stones unless
he carried a five-leaved clover; nor did he tell
him that if the treasure were carried away from
the heath it would turn to ashes unless a human
life had been sacrificed to the stones. As Bernet
listened to the story he became very grave. His
eyes shone through the fading light as he stared
at the beggar’s face.</p>

<p>“Why do you tell me this?” he asked. “And
why are you willing to share the treasure that
might be all your own? If you make me rich,
what do you expect me to do for you in return?”</p>

<p>“Do you not see?” answered the beggar.
“You are much stronger than I. I, as you know,
am a weak man and slow of movement. While
the stones are away we two together could gather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
more than twice as much as I could gather myself.
In return for telling you this secret, all I ask is
that if we go there and gather all we can, and
bring it away with us, you will make an even
division with me—that you will give me half of
all we get.”</p>

<p>“That seems only just,” said Bernet slowly.
“It would be strange if this story of the hidden
treasure proved to be true. At any rate, I will
come with you to the heath to-night. We will
bring with us some large bags, and if we
manage to secure even a small part of the gold
you talk of I shall never cease to be grateful
to you.”</p>

<p>The beggar could not answer. His teeth were
chattering, half with fear and half with excitement.
The honest stone-cutter little guessed that the
beggar was planning to sacrifice him to the
stones in order that he himself might become
a rich man.</p>

<p>It was well on toward midnight when Bernet
and the beggar returned to the heath with the
bags. The moon shone clear and bright, and by
its light they could see the stones towering up
above them, solid and motionless. It seemed impossible
to believe that they had ever stirred from
their places, or ever would again. In the moonlight
Bernet could clearly see the cross that he
had carved upon the largest stone.</p>

<p>He and the beggar lay hidden behind a clump<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
of bushes. All was still except for the faint sound
of the river some short distance away. Suddenly
a breath seemed to pass over the heath. Far off,
in the village of Plouvinec, sounded the first stroke
of twelve.</p>

<p>At that stroke the two men saw a strange and
wonderful thing happen. The motionless stones
rocked and stirred in their places. With a rending
sound they tore themselves from the places
where they had stood for so long. Then down
the slope toward the river they rolled, bounding
faster and faster, while there on the heath an
immense treasure glittered in the moonlight.</p>

<p>“Quick! quick!” cried the beggar in a shrill
voice. “They will return! We have not a
moment to waste.”</p>

<p>Greedily he threw himself upon the treasure.
Gathering it up by handfuls he thrust it hurriedly
into a sack. Bernet was not slow to follow his
example. They worked with such frenzy that
soon the two largest sacks were almost full. In
their haste everything but the gold was forgotten.</p>

<p>Some sound, a rumbling and crashing, made
Bernet look up. At once he sprang to his feet
with a cry of fear.</p>

<p>“Look! look!” he cried. “The stones are
returning. They are almost on us. We shall be
crushed.”</p>

<p>“You, perhaps; but not I,” answered the
beggar. “You should have provided yourself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
with a five-leaved clover. It is a magic herb,
and the stones have no power to touch him
who holds it.”</p>

<p>Even as the beggar spoke the stones were
almost upon them. Trembling, but secure, he
held up the five-leaved clover before them. As
he did so the ranks of stones divided, passing
around him a rank on either side; then, closing
together, they rolled on toward Bernet.</p>

<p>The poor stone-cutter felt that he was lost.
He tried to murmur a prayer, but his tongue
clove to the roof of his mouth with fear.</p>

<p>Suddenly the largest stone of all, the one upon
which he had cut the cross, separated itself from
the others. Rolling in front of them, it placed
itself before him as a shield. Grey and immovable
it towered above him. A moment the others
paused as if irresolute, while Bernet cowered close
against the protecting stone. Then they rolled
by without touching him and settled sullenly into
their places.</p>

<p>The beggar was already gathering up the sacks.
He believed himself safe, but he wished to leave
the heath as quickly as possible. He glanced
fearfully over his shoulder. Then he gave a
shriek, and, turning, he held up the five-leaved
clover. The largest stone was rolling toward him.
It was almost upon him.</p>

<p>But the magic herb had no power over a stone
marked with a cross. On it rolled, over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
miserable man, and into the place where it must
rest again for still another hundred years.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was morning, and the sun was high in the
heavens when Bernet staggered into the inn at
Plouvinec. A heavy, bulging sack was thrown
over one shoulder; a second sack he dragged
behind him. They were full of gold—the treasure
from under the stones of Plouvinec.</p>

<p>From that time Bernet was the richest man in
Plouvinec. Madeleine’s father was glad enough
to call him son-in-law and to welcome him into
his family. He and Madeleine were married, and
lived in the greatest comfort and happiness all
their days. But for as long as he lived Bernet
could never be induced to go near the heath nor
to look upon the stones that had so nearly caused
his death.</p>

<h2>THE KING OF THE BUFFALOES<br />

<small>AN AMERICAN INDIAN TALE</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>A &nbsp; LAME Indian and his daughter once
lived on the edge of a lonely forest, apart
from any tribe or village. The Indian,
whose name was Agodaguada, was a great hunter
and fisher in spite of his lameness. Every day
he went off into the forest, and while he was away
his daughter, Iola, took care of the lodge and did
the cooking.</p>

<p>They would have been very contented there
if it had not been for a herd of buffaloes that
lived on the other side of the forest. The king
of this herd was a magician. He had seen Iola
once as she was gathering wood in the forest, and
had fallen in love with her, for she was very
beautiful. Agodaguada often came upon him
hiding in the bushes near the hut, or heard him
bellowing down at a stream near by. Agodaguada
cautioned his daughter never to leave the lodge
while he was away, for he feared the buffalo might
seize her and carry her off.</p>

<p>He himself was tormented by the ungainly
beasts. They muddied the streams where he
fished and drove away the game by their bellowing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Gradually he was obliged to go farther and
farther from the lodge to find deer or fish. Often
as he sat quietly watching for game a hoarse
voice would begin to sing at him from behind
the bushes or rocks:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“You lame mannikin,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Don’t you think it a sin</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To pen up your daughter?</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">—Say, Agodaguada—</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To shut up your daughter,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Don’t you think it a sin?”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Sometimes he aimed an arrow or a stone at the
place from which the voice sounded, and then a
great dark body would go lumbering and crashing
away through the forest, and Agodaguada would
know that it was one of the buffaloes that had
followed him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 447px;">
<img src="images/i_082fp.jpg" width="447" height="546" alt="Buffalo and Indian maiden" />
<div class="caption">HE SPOKE TO HER IN THE SOFTEST VOICE
HE COULD MANAGE</div>
</div>

<p>One day, when Agodaguada was far from home,
his daughter climbed up on top of the lodge, and
sat there to comb her hair, for it was very long.
Every now and then she stopped to listen and
look about her, to make sure there was no danger.</p>

<p>For a long time all was silent except for the
singing of the birds. She finished combing her
hair, and was just about to go down into the
lodge when suddenly a great noise arose, a crashing
of underbrush and thundering of hoofs. The
herd of buffaloes, with the king at their head,
was charging down upon the hut. Iola had no
time to move before she felt the logs breaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
away beneath her. They were scattered this
way and that like straws. In another moment
Iola found herself seated on the back of the king
of buffaloes. She was being carried swiftly away
through the forest, while the lodge lay in ruins
behind them.</p>

<p>On and on went the buffalo, until at last, in the
deepest and darkest part of the forest, he paused
and allowed Iola to slip from his back.</p>

<p>This was the spot where he and his followers
had their camp, and it was here he intended to
keep Iola until she consented to become his wife.
He spoke to her in the softest voice he could
manage, telling her that this was to be her home,
but Iola would not look at him, nor answer.
She only turned away, wringing her hands and
weeping bitterly.</p>

<p>But the buffalo king was not discouraged.
He had the power to take the shape of a man
when he chose, and it was in this shape that he
meant to woo her and win her to be his wife.
And this he had no doubt of being able to do
before long.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Agodaguada had been trying to
fish, but he found his enemies more tormenting
than ever. Their hoarse voices sang after him
wherever he went:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“You lame mannikin,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Don’t you think it a sin</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To shut up your daughter?</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">—Say, Agodaguada—</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To shut up your daughter?</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Do you think she is in?</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Are you sure she is in?”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>As Agodaguada listened, he became thoughtful.
He rolled up his line and started back
through the forest toward the lodge. As he
came near his home he quickened his steps.
He noticed that the small trees and underbrush
had been trampled down as though a great herd
had passed that way. Presently he began to
run, and he was still running when he broke
into the open where his lodge had stood. But
the lodge was there no longer. Instead, he saw
only the ruins that the buffaloes had left behind
them. Iola was gone.</p>

<p>Agodaguada did not at once follow the enemy,
however. He ran to the ruins and began tearing
the logs aside and burrowing under them.
Presently he gave a cry of joy and drew out
from beneath them an old worn pouch of deerskin.
From this pouch he took a pair of moccasins
and put them on his feet. They were
magic moccasins and were Agodaguada’s greatest
treasure. And now he was ready to follow Iola
and save her from the buffaloes.</p>

<p>It was not hard to trace the way they had
gone. The herd had left a broad track of broken
trees and branches through the dark forest.</p>

<p>The magic moccasins leaped a hundred yards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
at each step. They carried Agodaguada along
faster than a bird can fly. The buffaloes had
gone at full speed, and had had the start of him
by several hours, but so swiftly he went that
by twilight he found himself close to their camp.</p>

<p>Here he slipped the moccasins from his feet.
As silently as a snake he crawled past the other
wigwams toward the lodge of the king.</p>

<p>As he came near it he heard the sound of a
flute, and soon he was close enough to look inside
and see who was playing. It was the king
himself. He had taken his human form and was
playing upon his flute a love song to Iola, but as
a man he was even more hideous than he was as
a buffalo.</p>

<p>Iola sat with her back turned toward him.
She looked very sad. Her head was sunk on
her breast, and she took no notice of his love
song or of his languishing glances.</p>

<p>Suddenly Iola started. From the thicket outside
had sounded the whistle of a partridge.
It was the whistle her father always gave as
he came near home after a day of hunting.
The buffalo, playing on his flute, had heard
nothing.</p>

<p>Iola sat still a few moments longer, and then
she rose. “I will go down to the spring,” she
said, “and fetch the water for the cooking.”</p>

<p>When the buffalo heard her say this he was
filled with joy. He took it as a sign that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
was now ready to live with him in his wigwam
and be his wife. Believing this, he was quite
willing to allow her to go down to the spring
by herself.</p>

<p>Iola stepped outside, and as soon as her father
saw her alone there he rose up from among
the bushes. His magic moccasins were once
more upon his feet. He motioned her to follow.
“Quick!” he whispered. As soon as they were
clear of the bushes Agodaguada lifted his daughter
in his arms and leaped away with her through
the forest.</p>

<p>In the lodge the buffalo waited for Iola a long
time. Sometimes he listened for her footsteps,
and sometimes he played upon his flute. At
last he began to grow suspicious and went out
to look for her. Everywhere he looked and
hunted, and at last he came to where her father
had hidden in the bushes, and there he saw the
marks Agodaguada had made as he had leaped
away with Iola in his arms.</p>

<p>Then the buffalo knew he had been tricked.
With a bellow of rage he called his herd together
and started after Iola and her father.</p>

<p>Agodaguada had already gone some distance,
but his daughter weighed him down, and the
moccasins could not move as swiftly as when
they had only himself to carry. He had only
just reached the edge of the forest when he heard
the buffaloes behind him. They had caught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
sight of him. The king gave a bellow of triumph.
But now Agodaguada was out of the forest and
leaping swiftly over an open plain. The whole
herd were thundering after him at full speed,
but just as the leader reached him Agodaguada
leaped aside. Before the buffaloes could stop
themselves they had charged on past him.</p>

<p>They turned and again rushed at him. But
suddenly a flight of arrows darkened the air.
Several buffaloes fell dead upon the plain, and
the king was wounded. These arrows were shot
by a band of hunters who had come to this plain
in search of game, and had hidden themselves in
a thicket. From there they had seen Agodaguada
race with the buffaloes.</p>

<p>Though the king was wounded, he would still
have pursued Agodaguada, but his followers had
turned tail and were fleeing back into the forest.
He stood pawing the earth and frothing until
another arrow struck him, and then, bellowing
with rage, he turned and followed his herd.</p>

<p>He did not stop at the camp, however. He
was so full of anger and chagrin that he went on
and on until he reached the wide plains of the
West, where he had never been seen or heard of
before.</p>

<p>But Agodaguada joined the band of hunters
who had saved him, and Iola was married to
their young chief and lived happily with him in
his lodge for ever after.</p>

<h2>THE JACKAL AND THE ALLIGATOR<br />

<small>A HINDU FAIRY TALE</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>THERE was once a little jackal who lived
near the banks of a great river. Every
day he went down to the water to catch
the little crabs that were there.</p>

<p>Now in that same river there lived a cruel
alligator. He saw the little jackal come down to
the river every day, and he thought to himself,
“What a nice, tender morsel this little jackal
would be if I could only catch him.” So one day
the alligator hid himself in the mud of the river so
that just the tip of his nose stuck out, and it
looked almost exactly like the back of a crab.</p>

<p>Very soon the little jackal came running along
the bank of the river, looking for crabs. When
he saw the end of the alligator’s nose, he thought,
“That looks like the back of a fine big crab,”
and he put in his paw to scoop it out of the mud.</p>

<p>As soon as he did that, snap!—the teeth of
the alligator came together, and there he had the
jackal by the paw.</p>

<p>The little jackal was terribly frightened, for
he was sure the alligator would pull him into
the river and eat him. However, he began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
laugh, though the alligator’s teeth hurt him
terribly. “Oh, you stupid old alligator,” he
cried. “You thought you would catch my paw,
and you didn’t catch anything but a bulrush
root that I stuck down there in the water to
tickle your nose. Ah, silly, silly alligator!”</p>

<p>When the alligator heard that, he was much disappointed.
“I certainly thought I had caught that
little jackal,” he said to himself, “and it seems I have
caught nothing but a bulrush root. There is no use
in holding on to that.” So he opened his mouth.</p>

<p>Then the little jackal snatched his paw out.
“Oh, stupid one!” he cried. “You did have
me, and you let me go again. Oh, ring-a-ting!
ring-a-ting! You’ll never catch me again.” So
saying, away he ran up into the jungle.</p>

<p>The alligator was furiously angry. “Well, he
tricked me that time,” he said, “but the next
time I catch him he will not get away so easily.”
So he hid himself again in the mud and waited
and watched. But the little jackal came no
more to the river. He was afraid. He stayed
up in the country and lived on figs that he
gathered under a wild fig-tree.</p>

<p>But the alligator was determined to have the
jackal, so when he found the jackal came no
more to the river he crawled out one morning
very early, and dragged himself to the wild fig-tree
and gathered together a great heap of figs,
and hid himself under them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>In a little while the jackal came running
toward the fig-tree, licking his lips, for he was
very hungry. When he saw the great heap of figs
he was delighted. “How nice!” he said. “Now
I will not have the trouble of gathering the figs
together; they are there all ready for me.”</p>

<p>He went nearer and nearer to the heap of figs,
and then he stopped. “It really looks almost
as though something might be hidden under
those figs,” he thought. Then he cried out
loud, “When I come to the fig-tree all the figs
that are any good roll about in the wind, but
those figs lie so still that I do not think they can
be fit to eat. I will have to go to some other
place if I want to get good figs!”</p>

<p>When the alligator heard this, he thought,
“This little jackal is very particular. I will
just shake myself and make the figs roll about a
little, or he will not come near enough for me
to catch him.” So he shook himself, and away
the figs rolled this way and that.</p>

<p>“Oh, you stupid old alligator!” cried the
jackal. “If you had stayed quite still, you
might have caught me. Ring-a-ting, ring-a-ting!
Thank you for shaking yourself and letting me
know you were there!” And then he ran away
as fast as his legs would carry him.</p>

<p>The alligator gnashed his teeth with rage.
“Never mind! I will have this little jackal yet,”
he cried, and he hid himself in the tall grass beside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
the path that led to the fig-tree. He waited there
for several days, but he saw nothing of the jackal.
The jackal was afraid to come to the fig-tree any
more. He stayed in the jungle and fed on such roots
and berries as he could find there, but as he could
find but little, he grew very thin and miserable.</p>

<p>Then one morning the alligator made his way
to the jackal’s house while the jackal was away.
He squeezed himself in through the doorway
(for it was very narrow), and hid under the heap
of dead leaves that was the jackal’s bed.</p>

<p>Toward evening the little jackal came running
home, and he was very hungry, for he had found
little to eat all day, and he was very tired too.
He was just about to go in and throw himself
down on his bed when he noticed that the sides
of the doorway were scraped and broken as though
some big animal had forced its way in.</p>

<p>The little jackal was terribly frightened. “Is
it possible,” he thought, “that the wicked alligator
has come to hunt for me here in my own
house and is waiting inside to catch me?” Then
he cried out aloud, “What is the matter, little
house? Every day when I come home you say
‘All is well, little jackal,’ but to-day you say
nothing, and I am afraid to come in.”</p>

<p>This was not true; the little house did not
really speak to him, but he wanted to find out
whether the alligator was there. But the stupid
alligator believed him. He thought to himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
“I will have to speak in place of the little house,
or this tiresome little jackal will not come in.”
He made his voice as small and soft as he could,
and said, “All is well, little jackal.”</p>

<p>When the jackal heard the alligator speak,
and knew he was really inside the house, he was
more frightened than ever. However, he answered
quite cheerfully, “Very well, little house! I will
come in as soon as I have been to the brook for
a drink of water.”</p>

<p>When the alligator heard that he was filled
with joy, but he lay quite still under the leaves
without moving. “Now I will have that little
jackal at last,” he thought. “This time he shall
not escape me.”</p>

<p>But while he waited the little jackal gathered
together a great heap of dead-wood and underbrush
and piled it up against the door of the house.
When it was big enough he set fire to it, and it blazed
up with a great noise and burned the wicked
alligator to death, and that was the end of him.
But the little jackal danced about and sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The alligator’s dead, and I am so glad!</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The alligator’s dead, and I am so glad!</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Ring-a-ting, ring-a-ting! Ring-a-ting, ring-a-ting!</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The alligator’s dead, and I am so glad!”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And always after that the little jackal could
go wherever he pleased in safety, and he ate so
many ripe figs and so many crabs that he grew
as fat as fat could be.</p>

<h2>THE BABA YAGA<br />

<small>A RUSSIAN FAIRY TALE</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>THERE were once a man and wife who
had no child, though they wished for one
above all things.</p>

<p>One day, when the husband was away, the
wife laid a big stick of wood in the cradle and
began to rock it and sing to it. Presently she
looked and saw that the stick had arms and
legs. Filled with joy, she began to rock and sing
to it again; she kept it up for a long time,
and when she looked again, there, instead of
the stick of wood, was a fine little boy in the
cradle.</p>

<p>The woman took the child up and nursed him,
and after that he was to her as her own son.
She named him Peter, and made a little suit of
clothes and a cloth cap for him to wear.</p>

<p>One day Peter put on his little coat and went
out in a boat to fish on the river.</p>

<p>At noon his mother went down to the bank
of the stream and called to him, “Peter, Peter,
bring your boat to shore, for I have brought a
little cake for you to eat.”</p>

<p>Then Peter said to his boat:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Little boat, little boat, float a little nearer.</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Little boat, little boat, float a little nearer.”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The boat floated up to the shore; Peter took
the cake and went back to his fishing again.</p>

<p>Now it so happened that a Baba Yaga, a terrible
witch, was hiding in the bushes near-by. She
heard all that passed between the woman and
the child. So after the woman had gone home,
the Baba Yaga waited for a while, and then she
went down to the edge of the river and hid
herself there, and called out:</p>

<p>“Peter, Peter, bring your boat to the shore,
for I have brought another little cake for you.”</p>

<p>But when Peter heard her voice, which was
very coarse and loud, he knew it must be a Baba
Yaga calling him, so he said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Little boat, little boat, float a little farther.</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Little boat, little boat, float a little farther.”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Then the boat floated away still farther out
of the Baba Yaga’s reach.</p>

<p>The old witch soon guessed what was the
matter, and she rushed off to a blacksmith, who
lived over beyond the forest.</p>

<p>“Blacksmith, blacksmith, forge me a little
fine voice as quickly as you can,” she cried, “or
I will put you in my mortar and grind you to
pieces with my pestle.”</p>

<p>The blacksmith was frightened. He made her
a little fine voice as quickly as he could, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
Baba Yaga took it and hastened back to the
river.</p>

<p>There she hid herself close to the shore and
called in her little new voice, “Peter, Peter,
bring your boat to the shore, for I have brought
another little cake for you to eat.”</p>

<p>When Peter heard the Baba Yaga calling him
in her fine, small voice, he thought it was his
mother, so he said to his boat:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Little boat, little boat, float a little nearer.</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Little boat, little boat, float a little nearer.”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Then the little boat came to the land. Peter
looked all about, but saw no one. He wondered
where his mother had gone, and stepped out of
his boat to look for her.</p>

<p>Immediately the Baba Yaga seized him. Like
a whirlwind she rushed away with him through
the forest and never stopped till she reached her
own house. There she shut him up in a cage
behind the house to keep him until he grew fat.</p>

<p>After she had shut him up, she went back
into the house, and her little cat was there.
“Mistress,” said the cat, “I have cooked the
dinner for you, and I am very hungry. Will
you not give me something to eat?”</p>

<p>“All that I leave, that you can have,” answered
the Baba Yaga. She sat down at the table and
ate up everything but one small bone. That was
all the cat had.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile at home the mother waited and
waited for Peter to come back from the river
with his fish. Then at last she went down to
look for him. There was his boat drawn up on
the shore empty, and all round it were marks
of the Baba Yaga’s feet, and the trees and bushes
were broken where she had rushed away through
the forest. Then the mother knew that a witch
had carried off the little boy.</p>

<p>She went back home, weeping and wailing.</p>

<p>Now the woman had a very faithful servant,
and when this girl heard her mistress wailing,
she asked her what the matter was.</p>

<p>The woman told her all that she had seen down
at the river, and how she was sure a Baba Yaga
had flown away with Peter.</p>

<p>“Mistress,” said the girl, “there is no reason
for you to despair. Just give me a little wheaten
cake to keep the life in me, and I will set out
and find Peter, even though I have to travel to
the end of the world.”</p>

<p>Then the woman was comforted. She gave
the servant a cake, and the girl set out in search
of Peter.</p>

<p>She went on and on, and after a while she came
to the Baba Yaga’s house. It stood on fowls’ legs,
and turned whichever way the wind blew. The girl
knocked at the door, and the Baba Yaga opened it.</p>

<p>“What do you want here?” she asked. “Are
you seeking work or shunning work?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am seeking work,” answered the girl.
“Can you give me anything to do?”</p>

<p>The witch scowled at her terribly. “You may
come in,” she said, “and set my house in order,
but do not go peeping and prying about, or it
will be the worse for you.”</p>

<p>The girl went in and began to set the house in
order, while the Baba Yaga flew away into the forest,
riding in a mortar, urging it along with a pestle,
and sweeping away the traces with a broom.</p>

<p>After the witch had gone, the little cat said
to the girl, “Give me, I beg of you, a little food,
for I am starving with hunger.”</p>

<p>“Here is a little cake; it is all I have, but I
will give it to you in Heaven’s name.”</p>

<p>The little cat took the cake and ate it all up,
every crumb.</p>

<p>“Now listen,” said the cat. “I know why
you are here, and that you are searching for the
little boy named Peter. He is in a cage behind
the house, but you can do nothing to help him
now. Wait until after dinner, when the Baba
Yaga goes to sleep. Then rub her eyes with
pitch so that she cannot get them open, and you
may escape with the child through the forest.”</p>

<p>The girl thanked the little cat and promised
to do in all things as it bade her.</p>

<p>When the Baba Yaga came home, “Well,
have you been peeping and prying?” she asked.</p>

<p>“That I have not,” answered the girl.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>The Baba Yaga sat down, ate everything there
was on the table, bones and all. Then she lay
down and went to sleep. She snored terribly.</p>

<p>The girl took some pitch and smeared the
witch’s eyelids with it. Then she went out to
where Peter was and let him out of the cage,
and they ran away through the forest together.</p>

<p>The Baba Yaga slept for a long time. At last
she yawned and woke, but she could not get her
eyes open. They were stuck tight with pitch.
She was in a terrible rage; she stamped about
and roared terribly. “I know who has done
this,” she cried, “and as soon as I get my eyes
open, I will go after her and tear her to pieces.”
Then she called to the cat to come and scratch
her eyes open with its sharp little claws.</p>

<p>“That I will not,” answered the cat. “As
long as I have been with you, you have given
me nothing but hard words and bones to gnaw,
but she stroked my fur, and gave me a cake to
eat. Scratch your own eyes open, for you shall
have no help from me.” And then the little cat
ran away into the forest.</p>

<p>But the faithful servant and Peter journeyed
safely on through the forest, and you may guess
whether or not the mother was glad to have her
little Peter safe home again.</p>

<p>As to the old Baba Yaga, she may be shouting
and stamping and rubbing the pitch from her
eyes yet, for all I know.</p>

<h2>TAMLANE<br />

<small>A STORY FROM AN OLD SCOTCH BALLAD</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>FAIR Janet was the daughter of the Earl of
March, and she was so beautiful that many
knights and noble gentlemen had asked her
to marry them, but she would say yes to none of
them.</p>

<p>One day she sat at her window sewing a seam,
and she heard the sound of a horn down in the
forest. It blew so sweet and it blew so clear that
she laid down her seam to listen, and it seemed
to her that it called “Janet, fair Janet, come
hither!”</p>

<p>Fair Janet dropped her sewing and down to
the wood she ran. She looked about her, and
there stood a handsome knight. From head to
foot he was dressed in green, and in his hand he
held a silver horn, and when he saw her he raised
it to his lips and blew again so soft and clear that
Janet had never heard anything like it.</p>

<p>“Now tell me,” said she, “is that a fairy horn
that it blows so sweet a note?”</p>

<p>“It is indeed a fairy horn,” answered the
stranger, “and it was in Fairyland that I learned
to wind it. In many a forest have I blown it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
north and south, and east and west, and you are
the first to hear and answer it.”</p>

<p>Then fair Janet was afraid, for she thought the
stranger must be a fairy knight, and she did not
know what charm he might cast about her.</p>

<p>The knight saw she was frightened, so he said,
“From Fairyland I brought it, yet I am of human
flesh and blood like you. I am the son of the
Earl of Murray, and once my name was John,
though in Fairyland they call me Tamlane. When
I was a child, the fairies stole me, and they have
kept me with them ever since. Bright and fair
it is in Fairyland, and I am the Queen’s favoured
knight, but my heart wearies to be back in my
own country and living with my own kind once
more.”</p>

<p>“And will not the fairies let you go?” asked
fair Janet, and now she was not afraid.</p>

<p>“That they will not of their own wills, and
only a lady brave and true can set me free. You
yourself are that lady, fair Janet, for you alone
have heard and answered my horn.”</p>

<p>Then Janet promised she would do whatever
Tamlane bade her do, if by so doing she might
bring him back from Fairyland, for he was very
good to look upon. She let him put a ring upon
her finger, and they kissed each other as a sign
that they were betrothed.</p>

<p>Then Tamlane told her what she must do.
On every Hallowe’en at midnight the fairies ride<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
abroad, and on that night she must go to Milescross
and wait for them to pass. At midnight
they would come.</p>

<p>First would ride the Fairy Queen, her horse
hung round with bells. After her would come
all her ladies and esquires, and then her band of
knights, and it was among these that Tamlane
would ride.</p>

<p>“You’ll know me from among them all,” said
he, “by the snow-white horse I ride. Moreover,
I’ll wear a glove on my right hand, but my left
hand will hang bare. Then is the time for you,
Janet. Spring up and pull me from my horse
and hold me tight. There will be a loud cry
raised, and they’ll change me into many shapes
in your arms, but hold me tight, whatever I seem
to be. Always it will be I, and I will not harm
you. Do this, and when I take my own shape
again I will be free of the fairies for ever.”</p>

<p>Janet promised to do all that he told her to,
though she was terrified at the thought of what
might happen, and then they kissed each other
again and parted.</p>

<p>Now three nights after it was Hallowe’en, and
Janet went out to Milescross, and hid herself there
and waited.</p>

<p>When midnight came there was a sound of bells,
and a white light, and the fairies came riding by.
First came the Queen, and she was very beautiful,
with a circlet of stars about her head. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
came her ladies and squires, talking and laughing
together; and next a troop of knights all in
green, and each with a silver horn. Some rode
on black horses, and some on brown, but one
knight there was who rode a milk-white steed.
His right hand was gloved, but his left hand
hung down bare at his side. He rode on and
never turned his head, but when Janet saw him
she knew him for her true love, Tamlane, and
she sprang forward and caught him by the mantle
and pulled him down from off his horse and
gripped him tight. Then from all the fairy train
there arose a cry, “Tamlane’s awa’!” “Tamlane’s
awa’!”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 489px;">
<img src="images/i_102fp.jpg" width="489" height="624" alt="Janet and the swan" />
<div class="caption">THEN IT WAS A SWAN THAT BEAT ITS WINGS
IN HER FACE</div>
</div>

<p>Suddenly it was no knight that Janet held in
her arms, but a great grey wolf. It struggled
and snapped, and its breath was hot in her face.
Almost it broke from her, but she remembered
Tamlane’s words and held it tight. And then it
was not a wolf she held, but a bale of burning
straw. The flames roared in her ears, but she
clasped it close, and it did not scorch her. Then
it was a great serpent that wrapped itself about
her, and tried to slip from her arms, but she
held it tight and did not let it go. Then it was
a swan that beat its wings in her face, but she
shut her eyes and held it. Then the wings were
still, and she opened her eyes, and saw it was
her own true love, Tamlane, that she clasped in
her arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>The Fairy Queen turned herself about, and she
cried, “Tamlane, Tamlane, if I had known
yesterday what I know to-day, I would have
taken out your two blue eyes and given you eyes
of stone; had I known yesterday what I know
to-day, I would have taken the heart of flesh
out of your bosom and put in a heart of clay;
had I but known yesterday what I know now,
never should you have ridden abroad with me
this night!”</p>

<p>Then suddenly the fairies were gone, and
Tamlane and Janet stood there alone. He took
her by the hand, and they went back to her
father’s castle together. There they were married
with great joy and feasting, and they lived
together happily all the rest of their lives, a
faithful and loving man and wife.</p>

<h2>THE FARMER AND THE PIXY<br />

<small>AN ENGLISH FAIRY TALE</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>FARMER BOGGINS lived on a lonely farm,
and there were a great many pixies and
other fairies all around.</p>

<p>One morning in threshing-time Farmer Boggins
went out to the barn before anyone else, and
what was his surprise to find that a great heap
of grain had been threshed out in the night. He
wondered who had done it. When his labourers
came to work he questioned them, but none of
them knew anything about it.</p>

<p>The next night the same thing happened; no
one went near the barn, but in the morning
there was a heap of clean grain on the floor.</p>

<p>The third night the farmer made up his mind to
find out who it was that was helping him, so he hid
himself behind some hay, and lay there watching.
The moon shone in and lighted all the floor, but for
a long time the farmer heard and saw nothing.</p>

<p>Then suddenly he heard a sound of threshing,
and there was a pixy beating out the grain with
a flail. The little man was not a foot high. He
was as brown as a nut and had scarce a rag of
clothes upon him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>He worked so hard that the sweat poured down
his forehead, and now and then he stopped to
wipe it away. Then he would cry out proudly,
“How I sweat! How I sweat!”</p>

<p>The farmer was filled with admiration, and the
third time the little man cried “How I sweat!”
the farmer could hold his tongue no longer, but
answered him, “That you do!”</p>

<p>No sooner had he spoken, however, than the
pixy was gone.</p>

<p>The farmer waited for a while, but the little
man did not return. At last Farmer Boggins
went back to the house and told his good wife
all that had happened.</p>

<p>“You stupid!” she cried, when he had made
an end of the story. “You should never have
spoken to him. The small folk cannot bear to
be spoken to!”</p>

<p>Well, the mischief was done, and now the only
thing to do was to think of some way to coax
the pixy back again to the work.</p>

<p>Early the next morning the good wife woke
her husband.</p>

<p>“Husband,” said she, “did you say the little
man had scarce a stitch of clothes upon him?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I said,” answered the farmer.</p>

<p>“Then listen,” said his wife. “To-day I will
make a little suit of clothes for him, and you
shall take it out and lay it in the barn where
he will be likely to see it if he comes back.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
Maybe then he’ll be so pleased he’ll get over his
anger and begin to work for you again.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 451px;">
<img src="images/i_106fp.jpg" width="451" height="578" alt="Farmer talking to pixies" />
<div class="caption">“NOT SO FAST, MY FINE LITTLE FELLOW,” HE SAID</div>
</div>

<p>Well, that seemed a good plan to the farmer,
so his wife set to work, and by evening she had
made a complete set of little clothes just the
size for a pixy. The farmer took it out to the
barn and spread it out in the moonlight and
hid himself where he could watch and see what
would happen.</p>

<p>For a long time all was still, and Farmer
Boggins was beginning to feel sleepy, when
suddenly he saw the pixy was there. The little
man had a flail in his hands and was going toward
a heap of grain. Then he saw the little suit
lying there in the moonlight. At first he stood
quite still, and then he laid down the flail and
took up the clothes. He looked at them all over,
and then he put them on.</p>

<p>When he was dressed he began to hop about
and sing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“How fine I am, how fine I am:</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Now I am nobody’s working-man.”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>So singing, he danced across the floor and out
of the barn and down the hill.</p>

<p>Then the farmer was in a rage. His wife had
taken all the trouble to make the clothes, and
the little man had taken them and gone off without
doing a stroke of work to pay for them.
But this should not be the end of the matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>At the foot of the hill the farm road crossed
a stream, and there was a bridge. The farmer
went down to the bridge and hid himself beside
it, for he thought that if the pixy were really
leaving the farm, this was the way he would go.</p>

<p>Sure enough, Boggins had not been hidden
there long when he heard a sound of voices, and
along came a whole troop of pixies. They all
looked exactly like the little man the farmer had
seen in the barn, but none of them were dressed.
Last of all came a pixy in a little suit of clothes,
so the farmer knew he must be the one who
had threshed out the grain.</p>

<p>Just as this pixy reached the bridge, Farmer
Boggins stepped out in front of him. “Not so
fast, my fine little fellow,” he said. “There’s
some work owing me in payment for that suit
you’re wearing.”</p>

<p>The farmer had scarcely got the words out of
his mouth when he heard a great splash in the
stream behind him, and a voice that sounded
like his wife’s cried, “Husband! Husband!
Come quick and help me, or I’ll drown.”</p>

<p>The farmer turned about, and immediately
there was a burst of elfin laughter. The stream
lay silent and smooth in the moonlight. No
one was there, and when the farmer turned back
to the bridge again every pixy was gone from it.</p>

<p>Then the farmer knew that he had been tricked,
and he had to go home without either the pixy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
or the suit of clothes. His wife was there though.
She had never been out of the house at all, and
a fine scolding she gave him for letting himself
be tricked that way by the little men.</p>

<p>But the pixy never came back to help him
with his grain, or to thank him for the suit of
clothes either.</p>

<h2>RABBIT’S EYES<br />

<small>A KOREAN FAIRY TALE</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>ONCE upon a time the king of the fishes
fell ill, and no one knew what was the
matter with him. All the doctors in the
sea were called in, one after another, and not
one of them could cure him.</p>

<p>Once when the fishes were talking about it,
a turtle stuck its head out of a crack in a rock.
“It is a pity,” said the turtle, “that no one
has ever thought of asking my advice. I could
cure the king in a twinkling. All he has to do
is to swallow the eye of a live rabbit, and he
will become perfectly well again.”</p>

<p>This the turtle said, not because he knew anything
at all about the matter, but because he
wished to appear wise before the fishes.</p>

<p>Now it so chanced that one of the fishes that
heard him was the son of the king’s councillor,
and he swam straight home and told his father
what he had heard the turtle say. The councillor
told the king, and the king, who was feeling very
ill that day, bade them bring the turtle to him
immediately.</p>

<p>When the messengers told the turtle that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
king wished to speak to him, the turtle was very
much frightened. He drew his head and his tail
into his shell and pretended that he was asleep,
but in the end he was obliged to go with the
messengers.</p>

<p>They soon reached the palace, and the turtle
was taken immediately to where the king was.
He was lying on a bed of seaweed and looking
very ill indeed, and all his doctors were gathered
round him.</p>

<p>The king turned his eyes toward the turtle,
and spoke in a weak voice. “Tell me, friend,
is it true that you said you could cure me?”</p>

<p>Yes, it was true.</p>

<p>“And that all I have to do is to swallow the
eye of a live rabbit, and I will be well again?”</p>

<p>Yes, that was true too.</p>

<p>“Then go get a live rabbit and bring it here
immediately, that I may be well.”</p>

<p>When the turtle heard these words he was in
despair. It did not seem at all likely that he
could catch a rabbit and bring it down into the
sea, but he was so much afraid of the king that
he did not dare to explain this to him. He said
nothing, but crawled away as soon as he could,
wishing he could find some crack where he could
hide himself and never be found again.</p>

<p>Suddenly he remembered he had once seen a
rabbit frisking about on a hill not far from the
seashore, and he determined to set out to find it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>He crawled out of the sea and started up the
hill. He climbed and he climbed, and after a
while he came to the top, and there he sat down
to rest.</p>

<p>Presently along came the rabbit, and it stopped
to speak to him.</p>

<p>“Good day,” said the rabbit.</p>

<p>“Good day,” said the turtle.</p>

<p>“And what are you doing so far away from
the sea?” asked the rabbit.</p>

<p>“Oh, I only came up here to look about and
see what the green world was like,” answered
the turtle.</p>

<p>“And what do you think of it, now you are
here?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s not so bad; but you ought to see
the beautiful palaces and gardens we have down
under the sea.” The turtle began telling the
rabbit about them, and he talked so long and
said so many fine things about them, that the
rabbit began to wish to see them for himself.</p>

<p>“Would it be very hard for me to live down
under the water?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” said the turtle. “It might be a
little inconvenient at first, but that would not
last long. If you like, I will take you on my
back and carry you down to the bottom of the
sea, and then you can see whether it is not
all just as grand and beautiful as I have been
telling you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, the rabbit could not resist his curiosity,
and he agreed to go with the turtle.</p>

<p>They went to the edge of the sea, and then
the rabbit got on the turtle’s back, and down
they went through the water to the very bottom
of the sea. The rabbit did not like it at first,
but he soon grew used to it, and when he saw all
the fine palaces and gardens that were there,
he was filled with wonder.</p>

<p>The turtle took him directly to the palace of the
king. There he bade the rabbit get down and wait
awhile, and he promised that presently he would
show him the king of all this magnificence.</p>

<p>The rabbit was delighted and willingly agreed to
wait there while the turtle went to announce him.</p>

<p>But while the turtle was away the rabbit
heard two fishes talking in the room next to
where he was. He was very inquisitive, so he
cocked his ears forward and listened to what
they were saying. What was his horror to find
that they were talking about taking out his eyes
and giving them to the king. The rabbit did not
know what to do, nor how he was to escape from
the dangerous position he was in.</p>

<p>Presently the turtle came back, and the chief
councillor came with him, and immediately the
rabbit began to talk. “Well,” said he, “it all
seems very fine here, and I am glad I came, but
I wish now I had brought my own eyes with me
so that I could see it better. You see, the eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
I have in my head now are only glass eyes. I am
so afraid of getting my own eyes hurt or dusty
that I generally keep them in a safe place, and
wear these glass eyes instead. But if I had only
known how much there would be to look at, I
would certainly have brought my own eyes.”</p>

<p>When the turtle and the councillor heard this, they
were very much disappointed, for they believed the
rabbit was speaking the truth, and that the eyes he
had in his head at the time were only glass eyes.</p>

<p>“I will take you back to the shore,” said the
turtle, “and then you can go and get your real
eyes and come back again, for there are many
more things for you to see here—things more
wonderful and beautiful than anything I have
yet shown you.”</p>

<p>Well, the rabbit was willing to do that, so he
got upon the turtle’s back, and the turtle swam
up and up with him through the sea.</p>

<p>As soon as they reached the shore the rabbit
leaped from the turtle’s back, and away he went
up the hill as fast as he could scamper, and he
was glad enough to be out of that scrape, I can
tell you. But the turtle waited, and he waited,
and he waited, but the rabbit never did come
back, and at last the turtle was obliged to go
home without him.</p>

<p>As for the king of the fishes, if he ever got
well, it was not the eye of a live rabbit that cured
him; of that you may be sure.</p>

<h2>MUDJEE MONEDO<br />

<small>AN AMERICAN INDIAN TALE</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>UPON the banks of the broad Ogechee
River there once stood a little Indian
village. The people who lived there were
prosperous and happy. There were fish in the
river and game in the forest, and no one lacked
for anything.</p>

<p>But after a time a terrible misfortune fell upon
the people. An ogre named Mudjee Monedo
came to live near them. Upon an open plain he
laid out a racecourse, and it was his amusement
to challenge the young men of the village to race
with him there. None dared to refuse, for the
ogre was cruel and revengeful, and they feared
what he might do to the old men and children
if they should refuse; and yet to race with him
meant death.</p>

<p>“Life against life,” the ogre would cry, laying
his hand on the goal-post. “My life in wager
against yours. This post is the goal, yonder
charred stump the turning-point. The loser pays
the forfeit with his life.”</p>

<p>But none of the Indian warriors ever could
win in that race with Mudjee Monedo. The ogre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
had the power to turn himself at will into any
four-footed animal that he might choose. If he
found he was being outstripped in the race he
would change himself into a wolf, a deer, or a
buffalo, and so easily win the race against the
swiftest runner of them all. So, one after another,
the finest young men of the village were slain at
the goal-post.</p>

<p>A deep gloom settled over those who were
still left alive. They would have taken their
wives and children and gone elsewhere to live,
but they knew the ogre would follow on their
tracks. Their only hope was that some time a
warrior might rise among them who would be
able to outwit the ogre and win the race.</p>

<p>Somewhat away from the other lodges, and
in the shadow of the forest, lived a widow with
a daughter and a young son. This son was a
boy of twelve named Manedowa. The widow’s
husband and her ten eldest sons had all raced
with the ogre at one time or another, and all
had paid the forfeit with their lives. Now
Manedowa was fast growing tall and manly.
Instead of being glad of this the widow was
terrified. She dreaded the time when the ogre
might think the boy old enough to race with him.
Already Mudjee Monedo had his eye upon him.
Often he would make some excuse to come to
the lodge when the boy was busy there. Then
the ogre would look him up and down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>“You are growing fast,” he would say. “You
will make a famous runner. Some time you must
come and look at my racecourse. Perhaps we
may even run a friendly race together—though
I am growing too old and stiff to have any chance
against young limbs like yours.”</p>

<p>Then the widow would shudder and make some
excuse to send the boy away out of sight. She
knew that when he was fully grown it would not
be for long that the ogre would spare him.</p>

<p>One day the boy was away fishing and the
widow and her daughter were busy in the lodge
together. Suddenly a shadow fell across the floor.
They looked up in terror, expecting to see the
ogre peering in. Instead, a handsome young
warrior stood there in the doorway. He was a
stranger. They had never seen him before. The
sunshine played upon his shining limbs like fire.
His eyes were bright and piercing, and above his
forehead waved a plume of gorgeous feathers.
For a moment he stood looking in upon them.
Then he laid a deer down upon the threshold,
and silently turned and disappeared in the green
depths of the forest.</p>

<p>Wondering, the mother and her daughter stared
after him. They did not know who he could be.
They waited for some time, and then, as he did
not return, they cut up the deer and hung it up
to dry.</p>

<p>Two days after this the stranger again came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
to the lodge. As silently as before he laid a bear
down before them, and again disappeared among
the thickets; but that night they heard the
sound of his pipe not far from the lodge; it was
a love song to the girl that he was playing.</p>

<p>The next evening he came again, bringing more
game, but this time he entered and sat down. After
that he stayed in the widow’s lodge, and the girl became
his wife. She was very happy, for no other
hunter brought home such fine game as he, and no
other was as handsome and as noble-looking.</p>

<p>Every morning he went away, gliding off
silently into the depths of the forest and disappearing
from their sight. Where he went they
did not know, but every night he came again,
bringing to them the choicest of game and fish.
The plume above his forehead shone with strange
colours, and sometimes it seemed as though the
light about him came from himself, and not from
the sunshine or the firelight. Neither the girl
nor her mother dared to question him as to who
he was or whence he came.</p>

<p>With so much game hanging about the lodge
it was not long before Mudjee Monedo grew
suspicious. He suspected that some warrior had
come to live with the widow and her daughter
and that they were hiding it from him. Often
he stole up silently to the lodge hoping to find
the hunter there, but he never saw him. At last
he questioned the widow openly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>“All this game,” he said, trying to smile at
her pleasantly, “where does it come from?”</p>

<p>The widow began to tremble. “My son—”
she began.</p>

<p>“Your son!” interrupted the Magician. “Do
you mean to tell me that your son could shoot a
bear or a buffalo such as I have seen here?”</p>

<p>“He is very large and strong for his age,” said
the poor widow.</p>

<p>“If he is old enough to shoot such game he
is old enough to race with me,” cried the ogre.
“I will come again when he is at home, and he
and I will talk of it.”</p>

<p>The Mudjee Monedo turned on his heel and
strode away through the forest, breaking the
young trees and muttering to himself as he went.</p>

<p>The widow and her daughter were almost dead
with fright. If they told the ogre of the strange
warrior who had come to live in their lodge he
would without doubt challenge the stranger to
race with him. If they did not, it would be the
boy who would be slain.</p>

<p>That night when the hunter returned as usual
with his game the widow told him of all that
had happened—of how Mudjee Monedo had come
to the lodge and questioned her, of how she had
pretended it was her son who had shot the game,
and of the threat that the ogre had used.</p>

<p>The warrior listened to all she had to say in
silence. When she had ended he answered calmly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
“It is well. I will run a race with this Mudjee
Monedo. To-morrow he will come this way again.
Then ask him to stop and eat with you, and I
too will be here.”</p>

<p>His wife and her mother began to beg and
implore him not to let the Magician see him,
but he silenced them. “Let it be as I say,”
said he. “To-morrow do you put corn meal and
herbs in a pot to cook, and add to it three birch
buds. Mudjee Monedo and I will eat of it
together.”</p>

<p>The next morning very early the ogre appeared
at the lodge door, but the stranger had already
gone into the forest. Mudjee Monedo looked about
him and saw all the fresh meat. “Truly your son
has become a mighty hunter,” he sneered.</p>

<p>“No, Mudjee Monedo,” answered the widow.
“I knew it was useless to try to deceive you.
It is not my son, but my son-in-law, who has
shot all this game. He is a mighty warrior. He
will soon return from the forest. Sit down, and
when he comes you can eat together.”</p>

<p>“Did I not know it?” cried the ogre triumphantly.
“No one may hope to deceive
Mudjee Monedo for long.”</p>

<p>He entered the lodge and sat down. He had
not been there long before the stranger appeared
in the doorway. The brave was in the full dress
of a warrior. Across his forehead was a broad
band of red paint, and the feathers above his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
forehead were red and blue. The ogre’s eyes
glistened at the sight of him. The hunter greeted
Mudjee Monedo, and sat down not far from him.</p>

<p>Presently, while his wife and mother-in-law
made ready the food, he and the ogre talked.
Soon Mudjee Monedo asked the warrior whether
he would not run a race with him upon his racecourse.</p>

<p>Calmly the stranger agreed.</p>

<p>“But I am growing old,” said Mudjee Monedo
slyly. “I am not strong and tireless as I was
once. Because of that, if I race with you you
must let me set the wager.”</p>

<p>To this, also, the stranger agreed. Then the
food was ready, and he courteously asked Mudjee
Monedo to eat with him. The ogre could not
refuse, but when he saw the dish that was set
before them he became very uneasy. Well he
knew that for him there was evil in that food.
The strange warrior, however, took no notice of
his confusion. He dipped into the dish and ate
of it, and Mudjee Monedo was obliged to do likewise,
though the herbs that were in it tickled
his throat and set him coughing.</p>

<p>Finally the warrior lifted the dish, drank deep
of it, and handed it to the other. The ogre
hesitated a moment. The broth was hateful to
him, but he was afraid to refuse. In haste to
be done with it he raised it to his mouth and
swallowed what was left of it at one gulp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly he coughed and choked. One of the
birch buds at the bottom of the pot had lodged
in his windpipe. His face turned purple and his
eyes seemed starting from their sockets. He got
to his feet and staggered out into the open air.
A moment he turned and tried to speak, but a
violent fit of coughing stopped him, and he
hurried away through the thickets, still wheezing
and choking as he went.</p>

<p>By the next day the news had gone through
the village that a strange warrior was to run a
race with Mudjee Monedo, and a great crowd
gathered on the hills near by to see the race.</p>

<p>When the stranger appeared upon the course
a murmur of wonder arose. Never had the people
seen such a warrior before. He was taller by a
head than the tallest youth in the village, and
his feet scarce seemed to touch the earth, so
lightly did he walk. Then hope sprang up in
the people’s hearts. Might it not be that this
wondrous stranger would in some way win the
race and free them from the power of the ogre.</p>

<p>Mudjee Monedo looked about him at the waiting
people, and seemed to read what was in their
hearts. His lips drew back in a cruel smile.
Then he laid his hand upon the goal-post.</p>

<p>“You have let me choose my own wager,”
he cried aloud, so that all might hear what he
said to the stranger. “It is this: life against
life; my life against yours. This post is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
goal, yonder charred stump the turning-point.
The loser pays the forfeit.”</p>

<p>“So be it,” answered the stranger in a clear
ringing voice. “I will abide by the wager, as
must you.”</p>

<p>At a signal he and the ogre sprang forward
on the course. Mudjee Monedo ran well, but the
stranger soon outstripped him. So swiftly he
ran his feet scarce seemed to touch the ground.
The light played about him, and his feathers
streamed behind him in the wind. Never had
the ogre been so easily outrun. Sooner than
usual he was obliged to turn himself into a wolf
or he would have been left too far behind. In
that shape he tore past the warrior, but as he
passed the stranger heard a wheezing in his throat
and knew that the birch bud was still there.</p>

<p>A low moan sounded from the crowd of watching
Indians on the hill-side as they saw the grey
wolf leading in the race. But the next moment,
the moan changed to a shout of surprise. The
strange warrior had changed himself into a partridge;
he rose swiftly in the air, flew past over
Mudjee Monedo, and lighted on the course far
ahead of him. Then he resumed his natural
form and again ran forward.</p>

<p>The ogre did not know what had happened.
He heard the shout and the whirr of wings above
him, and now he saw the stranger far ahead. He
was very much surprised, but again he used his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
magic and turned himself into a deer. With long
leaps and bounds he overtook and passed beyond
the running warrior.</p>

<p>Again there was a whirr of wings. The partridge
flew past overhead, and a mocking voice
cried in the ogre’s ear, “Mudjee Monedo, is this
the best you can do?” A moment later the
ogre saw the stranger once more far ahead, and
running as lightly and gracefully as ever.</p>

<p>The charred stump was passed and Mudjee
Monedo’s heart began to beat hard against his
sides. Never had he had to strive so hard. For
the third time he used his magic, and turned himself
into his third and last form, that of a buffalo.
It was in this shape that he generally won the race.
With his great shaggy head down, his eyes as
red as blood and his tongue lolling from his mouth,
the ogre thundered past the stranger.</p>

<p>Once again there was a whirr of wings. The
partridge rose from the ground and flew past
over the head of the straining buffalo. “Mudjee
Monedo,” he called from above, “is this the best
you can do? I fear you will lose the wager.”</p>

<p>With despair the ogre saw that the stranger
had once more flown far ahead of him, and
was now almost within reach of the goal-post.
Suddenly stopping, Mudjee Monedo resumed his
natural form. “Hold! hold!” he called to the
warrior. “A word with you.”</p>

<p>The stranger gave a mocking laugh. Springing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
forward he laid his hand upon the goal-post, and
a mighty shout burst from the watching people
on the hill. Then a stillness fell upon them. In
silence they watched the ogre as he slowly went
forward toward the goal-post.</p>

<p>As he drew near the stranger Mudjee Monedo
tried to smile, but his pale lips trembled. “It
was all a joke,” he muttered. “You will spare
my life, as I would have spared yours. You run
well and we must have many races together.”</p>

<p>“Wretch!” cried the stranger. “What was
the wager? Life against life; the loser pays
the forfeit.”</p>

<p>Swift as lightning he caught up the club that
hung from the goal-post, and with one blow he
struck the ogre to the earth. Then again a great
shout arose from the people, and like a stream
they flowed down from the hill-side and gathered
around the warrior.</p>

<p>For a time there was great rejoicing. Fires
were lighted and a great feast made. When
night came and the stranger went back to his
lodge a vast crowd followed him. It was growing
dark, but suddenly a pale light shone about the
warrior. He turned to them, and as they looked
at his face they suddenly knew it was no human
warrior who stood before them, but the Good
Genius, Minno Monedo. Silent and in awe they
drew back from him. He motioned them to leave
him, and they obeyed him, still in awe and silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>After they had all gone Minno Monedo turned
to his wife and took her by the hand. “The
time has now come,” he said, “when I must
return to the Spirit-land. It is for you to choose
whether you will come with me or stay here with
your own people. Which shall it be?”</p>

<p>“I will go with you,” answered the wife.</p>

<p>So it was; she and the Good Genius disappeared
from the earth, and her tribe saw them
no more.</p>

<p>For a while her mother grieved for her, but
Manedowa grew up strong and brave, and in
time brought home a wife who bore him many
children.</p>

<p>Grass grew over the course where the ogre had
run his races; his lodge fell into ruins, but still
around the camp-fires the Indians tell the story
of Minno Monedo, and of how he came to save
their tribe from Mudjee Monedo.</p>

<h2>DAPPLEGRIM<br />

<small>A TALE ADAPTED FROM THE NORSE</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>THERE was once a rich man who had
seven sons, and they were all stout, well-grown
lads.</p>

<p>When the man’s time came to die he called
his sons about him that he might divide his goods
among them. He asked each one, beginning at
the eldest, what he wished to have left to him.
One said one thing, and one another; one
wanted the house, and one the land; one wanted
gold, and one the flocks and herds. At last it
came the turn of the youngest, who was called
Boots, to say what he wished to have. But by
this time nothing was left to choose but seven
wild mares that ran about free on one of the
farther hills. All the other things had been promised
to his brothers.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Boots; “I am satisfied.
The seven mares will do for me. When they
have colts, I will leave the colts with their
mothers until they are big enough and then I
will sell them, and so I will have enough to live
upon.”</p>

<p>The six older sons thought Boots a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
simpleton to be satisfied with so little, but since
he was content, it was not for them to quarrel
over it.</p>

<p>Soon afterward the man died, and the six older
brothers divided his riches among them in very
friendly fashion.</p>

<p>As for Boots, he asked for nothing, but he took
his staff in his hand, and set out for the farther
hill to look at his seven wild mares. It was half
a day’s journey to the hill, but Boots thought
nothing of that. He reached it before his shoes
were worn out, and there were the seven wild
mares grazing hither and thither, and each one
had a foal with her. They were fat and well-grown
foals, but beside the seven there was
another colt there on the hill, and he was a
wonder. His coat was a beautiful dappled
grey, and shone like silk; and he was more than
twice the size of any of the other foals.</p>

<p>“Now in all my life never have I seen a colt
like that colt,” cried Boots. “The other seven
foals I will leave here with their mothers, but
this one I will take out into the world with me,
for already he is big enough and stout enough
for me to ride him.”</p>

<p>“Nay, Master,” answered the colt; “that is
not what you should do. Do you leave me here
for another year to run free and grow, and it
will be well worth your while. But as for the
other seven foals, take them to the market and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
sell them, and with the money you receive buy
me fodder. Store the fodder in yonder old ruined
building and leave the door open, so that I can
go in and out and eat at will, and by next year
I will be better fit for riding.”</p>

<p>Boots was willing to do this, so he gathered
the seven foals together and drove them away
to market. There he sold them as the dappled
colt had bade him and bought fodder, and this
fodder he stored in the old ruined building for
the colt to feed upon at will. Then the lad went
away to a city near-by and took service to wait
until the year was up.</p>

<p>At the end of the year, to a day, Boots came
back again to the hill, and there were the seven
wild mares at graze, and again each had a well-grown
foal beside her. But as for the dappled
colt, it was a wonder. It was twice as large as
before, and if before its coat had been like silk,
now it was like satin, it shone so.</p>

<p>Boots looked and wondered and wondered and
looked. “Well it is,” he said, “that I left you
here a year longer. But now you must go with
me, for with such a horse as you to ride upon,
the king of the country himself will be glad to
take me into his service.”</p>

<p>“Nay, Master,” answered the foal, “the time
is not yet. Let me run free for still another
year, but take the seven mares and their foals
to market, and sell them for what you can get.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
With the money buy fodder and place it where
you did before, and if you do this thing you will
never regret it.”</p>

<p>Well, Boots was willing to do that too. He
drove the mares and their foals to market, and
sold them and bought fodder with the money.
Then he went away to the city again and took
service for another twelve months.</p>

<p>At the end of the year, to a day, Boots came
back to the hill to look at his dappled colt, but
before he reached there he saw a light in the sky
and heard a sound as of thunder. The sound drew
nearer and nearer, and then Boots saw the colt
coming to meet him, and the noise was made
by its hoofs, for it was so huge that the earth
trembled under it as it came; and if its coat
had been like satin before, now it shone like
glass, so that the light was reflected all about it,
and that was what Boots had seen.</p>

<p>“By my faith,” cried Boots, “never have I
beheld such a horse before. The King himself
hath not another like it.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” answered the steed. “And
now, Master, the time has come for you to ride
me out into the world, and together we will make
your fortune.”</p>

<p>Then Boots tried to mount, but Dapplegrim
(for so Boots named the horse) was so huge that
he was obliged to lie down before his master
could get upon his back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>Once Boots was up, away the horse went, so
fast that the wind whistled past their ears, and
they never stopped nor stayed until they came
to the castle of the King of the country.</p>

<p>Here Boots knocked at the door and asked the
King if he might take service with him, and the
King could have jumped for joy at the thought
of having him. For never in his life before had
he seen such a horse as Dapplegrim; and as
for Boots, the King was sure that only a hero
could be the master of such a steed.</p>

<p>So now Boots was one of the King’s own men,
and soon he became such a favourite that the
King would have him always by his side, and
talked to him more than to anyone else.</p>

<p>But this made the noblemen who were about
the castle very jealous. And not only did they
have to make way for Boots, but all their own
horses had to be taken out of the castle stable
so that Dapplegrim might have the more room.
Before long they began to plot and plan as to
how they could rid themselves of Boots, and his
great grey steed as well.</p>

<p>Now, though the King of that country was
very rich and powerful, he was so sad that he
was never seen to smile, for he had had only
one child, a daughter, and her a troll had stolen
away. The troll kept her a prisoner in his house
at the top of a great glass hill. This hill was
as slippery as ice and as steep as a house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>Many princes and brave men had tried to
rescue the Princess, for she was as beautiful as
the day, and the King had promised her in
marriage to anyone who would bring her back
to him. None had succeeded, however, and
those who had tried had always lost their lives;
for though the King had promised her as a wife
to whoever could save her, he had also sworn
to cut off the heads of all those who tried and
failed.</p>

<p>Now one day several of the noblemen who
were jealous of Boots came to the King and
told him that Boots had been saying this and
that, and that he could ride up the hill on Dapplegrim
as easily as not, and could rescue the
Princess if only the King would ask him to.</p>

<p>As soon as the King heard this he sent for
Boots to come before him.</p>

<p>“How is this?” said he. “Why do you tell
others that you can rescue the Princess if you
choose, and yet you never tell me?”</p>

<p>“But I never said such a thing,” said Boots.</p>

<p>“Yes, but you did.”</p>

<p>“No, but I didn’t.”</p>

<p>The King would not listen to him, however.
He was determined that Boots must set out on
the adventure at once. If he rescued the Princess,
he should have her for a wife, but if he failed
his head should be cut from his shoulders.</p>

<p>As soon as Boots left the King, he went straight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
out to Dapplegrim’s stall, and he was down in
the mouth, as you may well believe.</p>

<p>“What is the matter, Master?” asked Dapplegrim.</p>

<p>“Matter enough,” answered Boots; and then
he told the great grey horse all that the King
had been saying to him.</p>

<p>The great grey horse listened attentively.
“This is no easy thing the King has asked of
you,” he said; “but it might have been worse.
And then it isn’t every day one has a chance of
winning a princess for a wife. Do you go back
to the King and ask him for ten pounds of iron
and twelve pounds of steel, and six blacksmiths
to do some work for us, for I must be properly
shod before we start out on this adventure.”</p>

<p>Well, Boots went back to the King and asked
him for just that, ten pounds of iron and twelve
pounds of steel, and six blacksmiths to work
for him.</p>

<p>The King did not say no. Ten pounds of iron
and twelve pounds of steel were brought to the
palace, and six blacksmiths came to shoe the
great horse Dapplegrim, and it was a task for
all six of them; for after the shoes were made,
it took three blacksmiths to hold up each one
of Dapplegrim’s feet and three more to fit the
shoe to it, but when it was done never any other
horse in all the world was shod like him.</p>

<p>Then Boots mounted and rode forth. On and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
on went Dapplegrim, so fast and far that you
might have thought they would have ridden over
the very edge of the world.</p>

<p>Finally Dapplegrim asked, “Master, do you see
anything?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Boots, “I see something far before
us. It looks like a wall of snow with a black
spot on top of it no bigger than a nut.”</p>

<p>“That white wall is the hill of glass,” said the
grey horse, “and the spot on top of it is the
troll’s house, but we have still a journey to make
before we reach it.”</p>

<p>Then on they went and on they went, and
after a while they came to the foot of the hill.
When Boots looked at it his heart sank within
him, for he did not see how any living thing
could keep a foothold on it.</p>

<p>“Well, here we are, Master,” said Dapplegrim.
“And now, unless we can mount the hill, it is
an ill day for you and me too.”</p>

<p>Then Boots gathered up the reins and rode
the great grey horse straight at it, and the
fire flashed from under Dapplegrim’s feet. Three
times Boots rode Dapplegrim at the hill. The
first time the great horse scarcely mounted as
high as a man could reach, and then his feet
slipped from under him and back he fell.</p>

<p>The second time he rode half-way up the hill,
and then again back, back he slipped.</p>

<p>The third time he sprang forward upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
hill of glass, and as his great feet struck it the
glass cracked and crashed beneath him, and up
and up he went, to the very top, and on into
the troll’s house.</p>

<p>The beautiful Princess was sitting beside the
window, weeping, her golden hair all loose and
falling about her, and the troll was there beside
her.</p>

<p>Dapplegrim thundered into the hall and over
to the Princess, and Boots stopped and caught
her up to the saddle beside him. Then Dapplegrim
wheeled, and away they went, faster than
the wind, and the troll did not even have time
to catch up the sword that lay beside him or
to try to stop them.</p>

<p>It was a long way back to the castle, and
Dapplegrim had two to carry now, but that was
nothing to him. On and on they went, and when
they thundered up to the castle gate the King
and all his court came out to meet them. Then
there were great rejoicings and kissings and
shoutings, as you may believe.</p>

<p>Boots stood there among them, and he was
the hero of it all. “And now, when am I to
marry the Princess?” he asked.</p>

<p>At that the King began to hum and haw. It
had been all very well to promise her to Boots
as long as she was sitting in the troll’s house
at the top of the hill, but now that she was back
in the castle again it was a different matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>“Listen,” said the King; “you shall have
her as a bride, of course. I have never said
anything different, but first you must level down
the ridge of rock there in front of the castle, for
it is so high and black that never a ray of sunlight
comes in at the windows from one year’s
end to the other.”</p>

<p>Well, that was not in the bargain at all, and
Boots did not know how he was to level down a
whole mountain of rock. But the King would
not listen to him. Not till the ridge was levelled
down could he marry the Princess, and moreover,
if he failed in doing it, his head should be cut
from his shoulders.</p>

<p>Then Boots went out to Dapplegrim’s stall,
and his mouth was down at the corners, as you
may well believe.</p>

<p>“Well, Master, and what is the matter now?”
asked Dapplegrim.</p>

<p>Then Boots told him all about it, and what
he had said, and what the King had said, and
how he feared he was to lose his head after all.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, this is not such an easy task,” said
the great grey steed, “but, after all, we may be
able to do it. But first do you ask the King for
twelve pounds of iron and fifteen pounds of steel,
and have new shoes put upon my feet, for we
will need them.”</p>

<p>That is just what Boots did. He asked the
King for twelve pounds of iron and fifteen pounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
of steel, and the King did not refuse him. And
this time it took eight blacksmiths to shoe the
great grey horse.</p>

<p>When Dapplegrim was newly shod, Boots
mounted upon his back and rode away toward
the ridge of rock, and the King and all his court
came out to watch what he would do.</p>

<p>Dapplegrim rode up to the top of the rocky
ridge, and then he stamped with his great iron-shod
feet, and he was so heavy that at once the
ridge sank down fifteen ells into the earth.</p>

<p>Then Boots rode up and down, and every time
Dapplegrim stamped the ridge sank down under
him, until at last it was as level with the earth as
the palm of your hand.</p>

<p>“And now may I have the Princess for my
wife?” asked Boots.</p>

<p>Of course, of course! The King had never
intended anything else, but before she could go
to church with Boots she must have a horse as
great and fine as Dapplegrim to ride upon. Boots
might have three days to find such a horse for
his bride, but at the end of that time, if he had
not found it, his head would be cut from his
shoulders.</p>

<p>Well, that seemed a hard thing to Boots. That
had never been in the bargain at all. Besides,
he doubted if there was such another horse as
Dapplegrim in all the world beside.</p>

<p>Out he went to Dapplegrim’s stall, and if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
had been down in the mouth before he was ten
times more so now.</p>

<p>“Well, Master, what is it this time?” asked
the great grey horse. “Are you not to have the
Princess for your wife?”</p>

<p>Yes, Boots was to have her, but not before he
should do this and that, and he told the whole
story to Dapplegrim.</p>

<p>“This is a harder task than either of the
others,” said the great horse. “There is only
one other horse in the whole world that is my
match in size and strength. Whether or not we
can get him I do not know, for he is very
wild and fierce. But before we start out on this
adventure I must be new shod with fifteen pounds
of iron and fifteen pounds of steel. Besides this,
you must ask the King to give you a barrel of
tar, twelve sacks of grain, and the carcasses of
twelve oxen, and twelve hides of bullocks set all
over with sharp spikes. Have these loaded upon
me, and then we will set out, and what is to
happen will happen.”</p>

<p>Well, Boots went to the King and asked for
all these things, and the King did not refuse him.
Dapplegrim was new shod with fifteen pounds
of iron and fifteen pounds of steel, and upon his
back were loaded twelve sacks of grain, and the
carcasses of twelve oxen, and the hides of twelve
bullocks set all over with sharp spikes, and a
barrel of tar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>Last of all, Boots mounted his steed and away
they rode, and the earth shook beneath them,
and the wind whistled past their ears.</p>

<p>They went on and on and on, till all the world
seemed left behind, and at last they came out
into a barren plain, and all the air around them
and overhead seemed filled with the sound of
the beating of great wings.</p>

<p>“Now tell me,” said Boots, “what is that
sound I hear, for it almost makes me feel afraid?”</p>

<p>“That,” answered Dapplegrim, “is the beating
of the wings of all the birds of the air that
have been sent out to stop us. But do not be
afraid. Cut a hole in each of the bags we carry,
so that the grain will run out, and the birds will
be so busy picking it up that they will never
notice us.”</p>

<p>This Boots did, and the grain ran out in a
stream behind them. Then the birds gathered
in such countless numbers that the whole plain
was covered with them. But they were so busy
pecking up the grain that they never even looked
at Boots or the great grey horse.</p>

<p>On rode Boots and on he rode, and after a
while he and Dapplegrim came into a great black
forest.</p>

<p>Then from all around there sounded a mighty
roaring that fairly shook the trees, it was so loud.</p>

<p>“What is that sound?” asked Boots. “Now
tell me, for it almost makes me feel afraid.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>“That,” said Dapplegrim, “is the roaring of
all the beasts of the earth that have been sent
out to stop us, but do you throw down the twelve
carcasses of the oxen, and the beasts will be so
busy eating them that they will never even look
at us.”</p>

<p>Boots did as Dapplegrim bade him, and immediately
from behind the trees and thickets
sprang out a multitude of wild beasts, and they
fell upon the carcasses and began to tear them
and eat. They did not even so much as look
at Dapplegrim or his master.</p>

<p>On and on went Boots and his great grey steed,
and now they came out of the forest upon a place
that was covered with great rocks and boulders,
and here Dapplegrim bade Boots light down.</p>

<p>“Master, the time has now come for the hardest
part of all our venture,” said the horse. “It
may be I will not come out of it alive, nor you
either, but that is as it may be. Take down
the barrel of tar and set it yonder among the
rocks, take off my bridle and then cover me all
over with the spiked hides. When this is done,
do you climb up in yonder tree, where you will
be out of harm’s way. Presently the steed that
we are in search of will come, and he and I will
fight together. Watch carefully that barrel of
tar, for while we are fighting it will be set on
fire. If the fire burns low and smoky, I will be
overcome, and then you must try to escape as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
best you can, but if the flame rises straight and
clear, then I am winning. In that case make
haste to come down and slip the bridle over the
head of the strange horse. Then he will become
gentle and quiet, and you may do with him
what you will.”</p>

<p>Boots obeyed Dapplegrim in everything. He
took down the barrel of tar and set it among
the rocks. He took off Dapplegrim’s bridle and
covered him all over with the spiked hides. Then
he climbed up in the tall tree near-by and hid
himself among its leaves.</p>

<p>No sooner had he done all this than Dapplegrim
struck the ground three times and neighed
loud and clear.</p>

<p>At once from far away there came a sound of
neighing. Nearer and nearer it came, and so
loud and terrible it was that Boots was filled
with fear. Then from beyond the rocks came
galloping a great grey dappled horse, and if
Dapplegrim was big, this one was full as large.
If Dapplegrim was strong, this one was as strong,
if not stronger. Fire flashed from his eyes and
smoke poured from his nostrils.</p>

<p>At once he and Dapplegrim began to fight.
Up and down they fought, and sometimes one
seemed to be winning and sometimes the other,
but always, whenever the strange horse tried to
seize Dapplegrim with his teeth, he could not,
because of the spiked hides that covered him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>As they fought, a spark from their hoofs fell
upon the barrel of tar and set it on fire. The
flame of it rose straight and clear through the air.</p>

<p>At once Boots slipped down from the tree and
ran over to where the two horses were fighting.
As soon as he did so, he saw that Dapplegrim
had seized the strange horse by the neck and
was holding him with his teeth.</p>

<p>Boots made haste to slip the bridle over the
strange horse’s head, and at once it became quiet
and gentle, only it still shook and sweated from
the fight.</p>

<p>Then Boots mounted on the new Dapplegrim’s
back and rode back toward the castle, and the
old Dapplegrim trotted along beside him. Safely
they passed through the forest and crossed the
plain, and as they neared the castle they saw
that the King and all his court had come out to
meet them, for they had heard the news of
their coming.</p>

<p>Boots lighted down from the new Dapplegrim
and led both horses to the King, and the King
was filled with wonder and amazement at the
sight of two such horses, and both exactly alike.</p>

<p>“And now,” said Boots, “can you tell me
which is the new Dapplegrim and which the
old?”</p>

<p>Well, the King looked them all over from head
to tail; he looked at their eyes and their ears
and their hoofs, and not a hair did one have that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
was different from the other’s. The King was
obliged to own that he could not tell which was
which.</p>

<p>“So I have brought the horse as you bade
me,” said Boots, “and now am I to have the
Princess for a wife?”</p>

<p>Well, there was nothing more for the King to
do but to let Boots marry the Princess. But
now the Princess herself had something to say
about it.</p>

<p>“Look,” said she to Boots. “You have shown
how brave you are: now let us see whether you
are clever as well. I will hide twice, and you
shall hide twice. If you can find me, and I
cannot find you, then we will know you are more
clever than I am, and I will marry you. But
if you fail, then you must look elsewhere for a
wife.”</p>

<p>Well, Boots did not like that very much, but
he did not know how to refuse. “Very well,”
said he. “Then that is the bargain.”</p>

<p>The Princess was to hide first, and this is what
she did. She changed herself into a white duck
and floated on the pond that was behind the
castle stable.</p>

<p>Boots hunted for her high and low; he looked
everywhere, but he could not find her. Then he
went out to Dapplegrim’s stall and told him all
about it.</p>

<p>“You should have come to me in the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
place,” said Dapplegrim. “Do you take a gun
and go out to the pond behind the castle stable.
Aim at the white duck that is floating there, as
though you meant to shoot it, and you will find
the Princess fast enough.”</p>

<p>Boots did as Dapplegrim bade him. He took
his gun out to the pond behind the stable, and
there, sure enough, was a white duck floating
about in the sunshine.</p>

<p>Boots took aim at it as though to shoot. Then
the Princess was terribly frightened. “Do not
shoot,” she cried; “it is I, the Princess.”</p>

<p>So Boots had found her once.</p>

<p>The next time the Princess hid she turned
herself into a loaf of bread, and lay with the
other loaves on the kitchen table. Boots hunted
for her high and low, but nowhere could he find
her. Then he went out to Dapplegrim’s stall.</p>

<p>“What shall I do about it now?” he said.
“I have hunted for the Princess everywhere, and
still I cannot find her.”</p>

<p>“Why did you not come to me in the first
place?” asked Dapplegrim. “Do you take a
knife and lay it on the middle loaf that is on the
kitchen table, as though to cut it, and you will
find the Princess fast enough.”</p>

<p>Well, Boots was not slow to do as Dapplegrim
bade him. He took a sharp knife and went into
the castle kitchen, and there were seven fresh
loaves of bread on the table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>Boots drew the middle loaf toward him, and
laid the sharp edge of the knife on it as though
to cut it.</p>

<p>Then the loaf cried aloud in a woeful voice,
“Alas, do not cut me! It is I, your Princess.”</p>

<p>And so Boots had found the Princess for the
second time.</p>

<p>Now it was Boots’ turn to hide, and while the
Princess was not looking he changed himself into
a fly and hid in Dapplegrim’s ear.</p>

<p>The Princess hunted for him everywhere, all
through the castle, but she could not find him.
Last of all she came to Dapplegrim’s stall to look
there, but when she tried to enter Dapplegrim
would not let her. He kicked and snorted and bit
until the Princess was fairly frightened.</p>

<p>At last she was obliged to own that she could
not find Boots. Then at once he stood before her
in his own proper shape.</p>

<p>“You have failed once,” he said. “Now let
us see whether you will be any more clever the
second time.”</p>

<p>The next thing Boots did was to change himself
into a clod of earth and hide in the hollow of
Dapplegrim’s foot.</p>

<p>The Princess hunted for him everywhere, but
she could not find him. Then she came to Dapplegrim’s
stall, and this time he let her enter. The
Princess looked him all over but could not find
Boots. Last of all she tried to lift Dapplegrim’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
feet to look under them, but this she could not do.
The great grey horse stood like a rock, and she
could not move him.</p>

<p>Then the Princess was obliged to own herself
beaten.</p>

<p>At once Boots stood before her. “Now,” said
he, “I have fairly won you for a bride, and you
shall not say no to me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes; that is right,” said the Princess.
“Now I know that you are the cleverest as well
as the bravest man in all the world, and you and
you alone shall be my husband.”</p>

<p>So Boots and the Princess were married with
great rejoicing and magnificence, and if anyone
were sorry it was not the Princess nor Boots.</p>

<p>As for Dapplegrim, nothing was too good for
him. If he had wished it, he might have had a
bridle of gold and a saddle set with precious gems,
and a silver bed to lie on. He lived to a good old
age, and they were all happy for ever after.</p>

<h2>THE FISH PRINCE<br />

<small>A HINDU FOLK TALE</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>THERE were once a Rajah and Ranee
who had no child, though every day
they prayed that one might be sent to
them. For this reason the Ranee at last became
quite melancholy, and took no more pleasure in
anything.</p>

<p>One day some fish were brought to the palace
kitchen to be prepared as usual for the Rajah’s
dinner. Among them was one such as the cook
had never seen before. Its scales shone with all
the colours of the rainbow, and upon its head was
a mark that looked like a little golden crown.
The cook examined it curiously, and then was
about to prepare it for cooking as he had done
with the others, but it lifted up its head and
spoke to him.</p>

<p>“Do not kill me,” said the fish. “Instead, put
me in a basin of water and carry me to the Ranee,
and it may be I will amuse her.”</p>

<p>The cook was very much surprised to hear a fish
speaking, and it seemed to him such a wonderful
creature that it might very well amuse even the
Ranee; he therefore put it in a basin of water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
and gave it to a maid, and bade her carry it to
the queen.</p>

<p>The maid did as she was told, and the Ranee
was indeed very much pleased with the beautiful
little fish. All day she kept it beside her and
watched its quick movements and its changing
colours. The next day she was even more pleased
with it, and before long she became so fond of it
that she could not have loved it better if it had
been her own child. She named it Muchie Rajah,
or the Fish Prince, and called it her son.</p>

<p>After a time the fish grew so large that it could
no longer live in the basin, and then it was put
in a marble bath. As it still continued to grow,
the Ranee had a great tank made for it out in
the palace gardens. Here every day she went to
visit it. She always carried some rice with her,
and when she called it, the great fish would rise
through the water and eat from her hand, and
play about where she could see it.</p>

<p>But one day when the Ranee came to the tank
she saw Muchie Rajah lying on the water very
still. His colours looked dull, and when she
called to him he came to her slowly, and would
not eat the rice she had brought to him.</p>

<p>The Ranee was greatly troubled. “Alas, my
dear son,” she cried, “what is it that ails you?
Are you sick, that you will not eat the good rice
I have brought to you?”</p>

<p>“I am not sick,” answered the great fish, “but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
I am very, very lonely. My mother, I beg of you
to have a little room built in the side of the
tank, and bring some young girl to live in it
all the time and be company for me.”</p>

<p>The Ranee could refuse nothing to her dear
Muchie Rajah. She immediately sent for masons
and stone-cutters, and had a little room made in
the side of the tank. The room was so cleverly
built that the fish could reach his head over the
side of it, and yet it was protected from the water
in such a way that one could live in it safely and
not be drowned. The walls of it were carved and
coloured and set with precious stones, so that
it was very beautiful, and there were hanging
lamps in it to give light by day and night.</p>

<p>After all was finished, the Ranee sent out
messengers through the country to find some
beautiful girl to come and live in the little room,
and be the bride of her dear Muchie Rajah. To
the parents of such a girl she promised to give
a lac of gold mohurs.</p>

<p>But though the messengers journeyed far and
near, they could find no parents who were willing
to give their daughter to the Fish Prince. “No,
no,” they said; “our daughters are worth more
to us than a lac of gold mohurs. This Muchie
Rajah is very large and strong and fierce, and
what he wishes is not a bride, but some young
girl to eat.”</p>

<p>Now not far from the palace there lived a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
fakir, whose wife had died and left him with one
daughter. This girl, whose name was Balna, was
very beautiful. After the death of his first wife
the fakir married again. The second wife also had
a daughter, but her daughter was as ugly as Balna
was beautiful, and as ill-tempered as Balna was
sweet and gentle.</p>

<p>The stepmother hated Balna and was very
jealous of her, and would have done anything to
rid the house of her.</p>

<p>One time the fakir went away on a long journey,
leaving his house and all that was in it in the
charge of his wife. The messengers were still
seeking for a bride for the Muchie Rajah, and as
soon as the fakir had gone his wife sent for them,
and said, “I have a daughter whom I am willing
to let you have for the Fish Prince, and as she is
very beautiful I am sure you will be delighted
with her.”</p>

<p>The messengers were very glad to hear this, and
said they would come for the girl the next day,
and bring a lac of gold mohurs to the woman in
payment for her.</p>

<p>After they had gone the stepmother called
Balna to her and told her what she had promised.</p>

<p>The girl was very much frightened. “Alas!”
she cried, “what have you done? The great
fish will certainly eat me. If my father had been
here he would never have allowed you to sell me.”</p>

<p>“This is silly talk,” answered the stepmother.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
“Why should the fish eat you? He is lonely and
wishes a companion. You ought to be proud and
happy to be the wife of a Rajah, even if he is
only a fish.”</p>

<p>She then bade the girl go down to the river and
wash her <i>saree</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> that she might be clean and neat
when the messengers came for her.</p>

<p>Balna took her <i>saree</i> and went down to the river
to wash it, and as she washed it she wept bitterly.</p>

<p>Now it so happened that an old seven-headed
cobra had a hole in the bank of the river, and lived
there with his wife and children. He heard the
sound of weeping just above him, and it kept on
for so long that after a while he stuck one of his
heads out of the hole and spoke to the girl.</p>

<p>“Why are you weeping here?” he said. “Do
you not know that your tears are dropping down
into my house like rain, and that they are very
salt?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Father Cobra, excuse me,” answered the
girl, “but I have good cause to weep. My stepmother
has sold me to be the bride of Muchie
Rajah, and I know he will certainly eat me, for
he is very large and fierce.”</p>

<p>“Listen to me, daughter,” said the cobra, “for
I am very wise and know all things. This great
fish you speak of is not a fish at all, but the Rajah
of a far country. In some way he offended the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
gods, and as a punishment he was changed into
the shape of a fish and sent to live in the river.
Now if you will do exactly what I tell you to do,
you can break this enchantment and become his
Ranee; but if you do not do as I say, then he
will of a certainty eat you as you fear.”</p>

<p>The cobra then gave the girl three stones,
and bade her tie them into the corner of her
<i>saree</i> so as not to lose them. “To-morrow the
messengers will come and take you to Muchie
Rajah,” he said. “They will put you in the
little room in the side of the tank. When it is
night, you must not on any account go to sleep.
If you do, you will be lost. But take these stones
in your hand and watch. When he comes near
you, throw a stone at him. Immediately he will
sink to the bottom of the tank and will lie there
for a while. When he comes again, throw the
second stone at him and he will again go away,
and when he comes for the third time, throw
the third stone. Then the enchantment will be
broken, and he will resume his natural form,
and you will have nothing more to fear from
him.”</p>

<p>The girl heard with joy what the cobra said to
her. She thanked him and tied the stones in the
corner of the <i>saree</i>, and then she ran on home
again. When she went into the house her stepmother
was surprised to see how cheerful she had
become. She no longer wept nor complained, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
when, the next day, the messengers came for
her, she was quite willing to go away with
them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 449px;">
<img src="images/i_152fp.jpg" width="449" height="577" alt="Girl throwing stone at fish" />
<div class="caption">SHE MANAGED TO THROW THE THIRD STONE AT HIM</div>
</div>

<p>At the palace the old Ranee was waiting impatiently
for the bride, and she was delighted
when she saw what a beautiful girl the messengers
had brought with them.</p>

<p>Balna was taken out to the tank, and a great
crowd of people followed to see what would
become of her. Many of them pitied her, and
they wondered that she went so cheerfully, for they
expected no less than that she would be eaten by
the great fish.</p>

<p>After she was put in the little room in the side
of the tank the crowd waited about for a long
time. Every moment they expected to see Muchie
Rajah rise through the water and swallow her,
but nothing happened. The water lay black and
still, and there was no sound but the lapping of
the little waves against the stonework.</p>

<p>After a while night came, and the people grew
tired of waiting and went away to their homes.
Balna was left in the little room all alone. She
untied the corner of her saree and took out the
three stones. Two she laid on the floor beside
her, and one she kept in her hand.</p>

<p>About midnight the water was disturbed. The
waves dashed louder against the stones. There
was a hissing sound, and Muchie Rajah rose
through the water. He came rushing on toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
the room, his mouth open, and his scales as red
as rubies.</p>

<p>Balna was terribly frightened, but she held the
stone fast and waited. When he was almost near
enough to seize her, she threw the stone at him.</p>

<p>Immediately Muchie Rajah closed his jaws and
sank down into the depths of the water where
she could not see him.</p>

<p>After that she waited and watched for some
time, but all was still. Then again the waves
dashed louder. They rose to the edge of the
stonework. Muchie Rajah came rushing through
the water again, his mouth open, and his scales
shining like fire.</p>

<p>Balna was more frightened than ever, but she
threw the second stone at him, and again he sank
through the water, and all was still.</p>

<p>This time he was gone longer than before, and
the girl watched and waited. Then, suddenly,
with a roaring sound, he came rushing at her
again; his tail beat the waters into foam about
him; his scales shone so red that the whole tank
seemed full of blood.</p>

<p>Balna was almost dead with fright, but she
managed to throw the third stone at him. No
sooner did it touch Muchie Rajah than the enchantment
was broken. Instead of the great fish,
a handsome young Rajah stood there before her.
He was dressed in cloth of gold embroidered in
wonderful colours. His turban was fastened with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
an enormous ruby, and on his breast hung a
chain set with precious stones. He took Balna
by the hand and spoke to her.</p>

<p>“You have saved both my life and your own,”
he said. “The enchantment is broken, and now
we can live together happily, and you and you
only shall be my bride.”</p>

<p>Very early the next morning the Ranee and
her attendants came out to the tank to see whether
the girl was still alive, or whether she had been
eaten by the great fish. What was their surprise
to find in the tank room not only Balna, but a
handsome young prince, who told them he was
Muchie Rajah. He also told them how Balna had
broken the enchantment, and that now he would
marry her and live in his own proper shape for ever.</p>

<p>Then there was great rejoicing, and the old
Rajah and Ranee adopted the Fish Prince as their
own son, and Balna was to them in place of a
daughter.</p>

<p>When the fakir’s wife heard what had happened
to Balna, and how, instead of being eaten by the
fish, she had become the bride of a great Rajah,
she was ready to die with rage and spite. However,
she hid her feelings and went to the palace
and made friends with Balna. She pretended
that she had only wished her well, and had known
all along how it would turn out. Balna, who
was very simple and forgiving, believed all the
wicked stepmother said to her. She made her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
and the step-sister welcome at the palace, and
gave them many gifts, but they only hated her
more and more and were always plotting how
they could injure her.</p>

<p>One time Balna and her stepmother and her
step-sister went down to walk by the river in the
cool of the afternoon. Presently the step-sister
began to admire the young Ranee’s jewels, and
she asked Balna to let her try them on: “For,”
said she, “I have never worn such beautiful
jewels as those are.”</p>

<p>Balna was quite willing, and she took off the
jewels and put them upon her sister—the armlets,
the necklaces, the rings, and the bracelets. Just
at the last the step-sister allowed one of the earrings
to fall to the ground. “Look,” cried she,
“I have dropped an earring. Do you pick it up
for me, Balna, for I fear that if I stoop others
may fall off too.”</p>

<p>The young Ranee stooped for the earring.
Then the stepmother gave her such a push that
she fell into the river. The place where she fell
in was very deep, and she sank out of sight
immediately.</p>

<p>The two wicked women waited there for a
while, but they saw nothing of her, so they were
sure she must be drowned; then they went back
to the palace.</p>

<p>The step-sister was still wearing all of Balna’s
jewels, and she was so covered up with them that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
every one thought she was the young Ranee.
They went at once to Balna’s apartments, and
there the fakir’s wife put her daughter to bed,
and gave out that the Ranee was very ill and
could see no one. It was a long time before even
Muchie Rajah himself was allowed to enter the
room. When he did, he was shocked to see how
his beautiful bride had changed.</p>

<p>“It is because of her illness,” said the fakir’s
wife. “Wait until she is well again, then all
will be as it was before.”</p>

<p>The young Rajah never doubted but that it
was his bride who lay there, and he was very
unhappy because his delicate Ranee had become
so coarse and ugly and stupid. Still he was
kind to her, and often came to visit her in her
apartments.</p>

<p>But Balna had not been drowned as her stepmother
and her sister thought. It so happened
that the place where she had fallen into the river
was close to where the old seven-headed cobra
had his hole. He had heard the sound of voices
overhead, and then a great splash; he looked
out to see what had caused it, and there he saw
the young Ranee struggling in the water. He
felt sorry for her, and reached out and drew her
into his hole. Then he carried her up to where
she could get some air, for his hole had two openings,
one into the river and one out on to the
bank overhead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>The young Ranee was almost drowned, but
presently she came to herself again. Then she
wished to set out for the palace, but this the
cobra would not allow her to do.</p>

<p>“Your stepmother and your sister are there
even now,” he said, “and if you went back they
would certainly do you some harm. Stay here
with me, and if your husband, the Rajah, comes
to look for you, I will let you go back with him,
but not otherwise.”</p>

<p>When Balna heard this she was very sad, but
she was obliged to stay there in the cobra’s hole,
as he said. After a time her little son was born
there, and she named him Muchie Lal, the Ruby
Fish, after his father.</p>

<p>The little Muchie Lal grew up strong and
straight and handsome, and the old cobra became
so fond of him that he loved him better
than he did his own children; there was scarcely
anything he would refuse him.</p>

<p>One day a bangle-seller came past the cobra’s
hole, and Muchie Lal wished to buy some of his
bangles, but the cobra said, “No, these are very
common bangles, and not suitable for a prince to
wear. I will give the man some jewels, and he
shall make for you bangles such as you ought to
have.”</p>

<p>The cobra then brought from his treasure-house
a number of diamonds and rubies and other
precious stones. He gave them to the bangle-seller.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
“Take these,” he said, “and make them
into bangles, and bring them back to me as
quickly as possible and you shall be well paid.
And remember, they must be very handsome, for
they are for this prince, Muchie Lal.”</p>

<p>The bangle-seller took the stones home with
him and made the bangles, and they were finished
in a week’s time. Then he started out to carry
them back to the cobra. They were very handsome,
and he was so proud of them that he
carried them so that every one might see.</p>

<p>Now on his way it so chanced that he met
Muchie Rajah, and the prince was so surprised
to see a poor man carrying such costly bangles
that he stopped and began to question him.</p>

<p>“Those are very handsome jewels,” said he.
“I have never seen finer. Even I myself have
none like them. Tell me, how did you come by
them?”</p>

<p>“They are not mine,” answered the bangle-seller;
“they belong to an old seven-headed cobra
who lives down by the river. He gave them to
me to make into bangles for a young prince named
Muchie Lal, who lives with him.”</p>

<p>The Rajah was very much surprised at what
the bangle-seller told him. “This is a strange
story,” said he. “I will go with you, for I should
like to see this young prince who lives in a cobra’s
hole.”</p>

<p>So Muchie Rajah went down to the river bank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
with the bangle-seller. Muchie Lal was there
playing close to the cobra’s hole with the young
cobras. When he saw the bangle-seller he ran
to meet him, calling to him to know whether he
had brought the bangles; and the young prince
was so exactly like his mother, the beautiful
Balna, that the Rajah was filled with joy and
sorrow.</p>

<p>“Tell me, child,” he cried, “who are you, and
who was your mother?”</p>

<p>“I am Muchie Lal,” answered the boy, “and
my mother is the Ranee Balna, and we live here by
the river in the hole of an old seven-headed cobra.”</p>

<p>Then Muchie Rajah knelt down by the cobra’s
hole and called, “Oh, my dear wife, if it is you,
and you are still alive, answer me!”</p>

<p>Balna heard his voice down in the cobra’s hole,
and came running out and threw herself into
his arms.</p>

<p>“Oh, I have waited for you so long,” she cried,
“but you have come at last, and now I can go
back with you to the palace.”</p>

<p>So they were very happy. Only the cobra was
sad to have them go, and the cobra’s children
were grieved to lose their little playmate. But
he promised them to come back sometimes and
play with them there by the river.</p>

<p>Then the Rajah and the Ranee and Muchie Lal
all went back to the palace together, and there
was great rejoicing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>But when the fakir’s wife and her daughter
heard that Balna was still alive, and that her
husband had found her, they were so frightened
that they ran away and hid themselves in the
deep forest, and no one has ever heard of them
again from that day to this.</p>

<h2>THE MAGIC RICE KETTLE<br />

<small>A KOREAN STORY</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>THERE was once an old man who was so
poor he was scarcely able to buy food
enough to keep him alive.</p>

<p>He had never married, and so he had no
children, but he had a little dog and cat that
lived with him, and these two he loved as though
they were his own son and daughter. What little
he had was shared with them, and if they were
sometimes hungry, it was because he had nothing
in the house to eat.</p>

<p>One day the old man found that all he had
was one scant handful of rice.</p>

<p>“Alas, my little dog and cat, what will become
of us now?” he cried. “This handful of rice is
all that is left to keep us alive. After it is gone,
you must seek another master who can feed you
better than I. Even if I must starve, that is no
reason why you should too.”</p>

<p>The little cat mewed, and the dog looked up
into his master’s face, as though they had understood
all he said to them.</p>

<p>The old man put the rice over the fire to cook,
and just as it was done, and he was about to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
feed the animals, the light in the hut was darkened;
looking round, he saw a tall stranger standing
in the open doorway.</p>

<p>“Good day,” said the stranger.</p>

<p>“Good day,” answered the old man.</p>

<p>“I have come a long way,” said the stranger,
“and I am footsore and weary. May I come in
and rest?”</p>

<p>Yes, he might do that and welcome.</p>

<p>The stranger came in and sat down in the most
comfortable place. “I am hungry as well as
weary.”</p>

<p>“Alas,” cried the old man, “this is a poor
house in which to seek for food.”</p>

<p>The stranger looked all about him. “Is not that
rice that I see?” he asked, pointing to the kettle.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is rice, but my little dog and cat are
hungry also, and not another morsel have we in
the house beside that.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, it is right that a man should
be fed before dumb brutes,” said the stranger.
“Give me at least a taste of the rice before you
feed them.”</p>

<p>The old man did not know how to refuse him.</p>

<p>“Take some of it, then,” he said, “but leave
a little for them, I beg of you.”</p>

<p>At once the stranger dipped into the kettle and
began to eat, and he ate so fast that before the
old man could stop him, all the rice was gone
from the kettle, to the very last grain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>The old man was cut to the heart to think
that his guest could have done this. Now his
little dog and cat would have to go to bed hungry.
All the same, he said nothing. He took up the
empty kettle and was about to put it back on
the shelf when the stranger said to him, “Fill
the kettle with water and hang it over the fire
again.”</p>

<p>“Why should I do that?” asked the old man.
“Water will not fill our stomachs or satisfy our
hunger.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, do as I bid you,” said the
stranger.</p>

<p>He spoke in such a way that the old man did
not dare to disobey him. Muttering to himself,
he filled the kettle with water and hung it over
the fire.</p>

<p>The stranger drew out a piece of something
that looked like amber and threw it in the pot.
At once the water began to boil, and as it did so
it became filled with rice. And such rice! The
grains were twice as big as usual, and from them
arose a smell more delicious than anything the
old man had ever smelled before in all his life.</p>

<p>Filled with wonder and fear, he turned toward
where the stranger had been sitting, but the guest
was gone. He had disappeared, and only the
little cat and dog were left in the room, waiting
hungrily for their dinner.</p>

<p>The old man lifted the kettle from the fire and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
began to serve out the rice. And now a still more
wonderful thing happened. No matter how much
was dipped out from the kettle, still it was always
full. He could hardly believe his eyes. He
dipped and dipped. Soon all the pots and kettles
and bowls in the house were full of rice, and still
the more he took out the more there was.</p>

<p>“It is magic,” cried the old man. “It must
be that the amber the stranger threw in the pot
was a charm. If so, puss and my dog and I need
never suffer hunger again.”</p>

<p>And so it turned out to be. As long as the
amber was in the kettle, it was always full of
rice to the brim. The rice was always fresh, and
delicious too, so that not only the neighbours
but the people from the village across the river
came to buy it; and they paid well for it.</p>

<p>The little cat and dog grew fat and sleek. As
for the man, he not only had enough to eat, but
he was able to buy for himself all the clothes he
needed and to make presents to those who were
poorer than himself.</p>

<p>One evening the old man felt very tired. So
many people had come through the day to buy
rice that his arm quite ached with serving it
out.</p>

<p>He took a bowl and filled it for the cat and
dog, and was about to set it on the floor when he
noticed to his surprise that the kettle was not
as full as it had been. He took another bowl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
and dipped out some more of the rice. The
kettle failed to fill itself.</p>

<p>Again he dipped, and the more he took out,
the emptier the kettle grew. The old man was
very much frightened. He plunged his hands
into the rice that was left in the kettle and began
to feel about for the charm, but it was not there.
Somehow, that day, while he was dipping out
the rice for his customers, he must have dipped
out the charm, and some one had carried it off
home with his bowl of rice.</p>

<p>The old man was ready to tear his hair with
despair. At once he ran out and began to go
about the neighbourhood, knocking at all the
doors and begging to know whether a piece of
amber had been found in the rice the people there
had bought that day. But every one told him
no. They had found nothing in their bowls but
rice.</p>

<p>Worn out with sorrow, he went back to his
hut at last and threw himself on the floor to sleep.
It was a long time, however, before he could close
his eyes. Soon all the money that had been
paid him for the rice would be spent, and he was
too old to work. Then there would be nothing
for him but the same poverty and hunger he had
endured for so many years. And his little dog
and cat would have to suffer with him unless
they were wise enough to run away and seek
another master. At last, toward morning, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
old man fell asleep, and then the dog and cat
began to talk together in low tones.</p>

<p>“This is a bad business,” said the dog.</p>

<p>“Bad enough,” answered puss. “Our master
has been very careless. He deserves to suffer.
As for me, I have no notion of being half-starved
again the way I used to be. I shall go away
and try to find another home where there will
be more to eat than here.”</p>

<p>“You are very ungrateful,” answered the dog.
“Instead of planning to run away, you ought to
set your wits to work to think how we can help
our master.”</p>

<p>“But how could we do that? I know of no
way.”</p>

<p>“Let us go out and hunt for the charm. Perhaps
we can find it. Our sense of smell is so
keen that if we came anywhere near where it is
I am sure we could find it, however well it was
hidden. We will go from house to house—all
through the village, if need be. I will nose about
in the gardens and out-buildings, and you must
manage to creep into the houses and hunt about
through the rooms.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” answered the cat. “I am sure
I would be glad enough to help our master, and to
stay with him too, if only he could give us enough
to eat.”</p>

<p>So, early the next day, before the old man was
awake, the dog and the cat started out together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
on their search. The people of the village were
still asleep, but the cat managed to find a way to
creep into several of the houses, and the dog
searched about outside, as he had promised to do.</p>

<p>But with all their searchings, they found
nothing except some scraps of food here and
there. These they ate, and so satisfied their
hunger somewhat. Then, when night came, they
returned home, footsore and weary.</p>

<p>The old man was very glad to see them. All
day he had missed them and had wondered
where they were. He had saved some supper
for them and was surprised that they did not
seem more hungry for it. He was still very sad.
All day people had been coming to the hut to
buy rice from him, and when they found he had
none to sell, they had been very much disappointed.
Some of them had even been angry
and had scolded him.</p>

<p>The following day the dog and cat continued
their search, but night found them still unsuccessful.
So it went on, day after day and week after
week. At last they had visited every house in
the village, but they had seen and heard nothing
of the charm.</p>

<p>“Now you see how it is. We are only wasting
our time,” said the cat. “I knew we could not
find it, and I, for one, shall begin to look for
another home.”</p>

<p>“Nay, but wait a bit,” answered the dog.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
“Have you forgotten that many of our master’s
customers came from the village across the river?
We have not searched there yet.”</p>

<p>“No, nor will we as far as I am concerned,”
answered the cat. “I am no swimmer. I have
no idea of getting drowned. If you want to
search there, you will have to go by yourself.”</p>

<p>The dog began to beg and plead with her.
“Very soon,” said he, “the river will be frozen, and
then we can cross on the ice without your wetting
even the smallest toe of your paw. Only come!”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the cat at last. “I will do
it; but mind you, we must wait until the river
is well frozen, and there is no chance of our breaking
through.”</p>

<p>The dog agreed to this, and so, one cold day,
when the river was as hard as stone, the two
friends crossed to the farther side, and at once
began to search the houses there.</p>

<p>At the first house they found nothing. At
the second it was the same thing; but no sooner
had the cat entered the third house than she
smelled something that reminded her of the rice
that had bubbled up in the magic kettle. She
made her way from one room to the other, and
at last she came to a small upper chamber that
seemed to be unused. And now she could smell
the charm more strongly than ever, and the
smell seemed to come from the top of a high
chest of drawers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>With a bound puss leaped to the top of it
and looked about her. There, pushed well back
against the wall, was a heavy wooden box, and
the moment the cat put her nose to the keyhole
she knew that the charm was inside of it.</p>

<p>She had found the charm, and that was one
thing, but how to get it out of the box was quite
a different matter. The box was locked, and puss
soon found it was impossible to raise the lid.
She tried to push it off the chest of drawers,
hoping that if it fell on the floor it might burst
open, but the box was so heavy that she could
not budge it a hair’s breadth. It seemed a hopeless
matter. If the dog were only there, no
doubt he could have pushed the box off; but
then he had no way of getting into the house;
and even if he did, he could not climb to the
top of the chest of drawers.</p>

<p>But when puss went down to tell him about
it, he did not seem to think it was such a hopeless
matter after all. He was overjoyed that she
had found the charm, and was sure that they
could get it out of the box some way or
other.</p>

<p>“What we need,” said he, “is to get a good
big rat to come and gnaw a hole in the box
for us.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but that is not so easy to do,” said the
cat. “The rats have no love for me, as you
very well know. I have caught and eaten too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
many of them. I believe they would be glad to
starve me to death if they only could.”</p>

<p>“You might make a bargain with them,” said
the dog. “They would be glad enough to help
you, if you, in return, would promise not to
catch any of them for ten years to come.”</p>

<p>Well, the cat did not want to make that bargain
at all. She was too fond of catching the rats
whenever she could. She and the dog argued
about it for a long time, but at last she agreed
to do as he wished.</p>

<p>The next thing was to get a message to the
king of the rats, and puss knew of a way to manage
that. She had seen a mouse-hole near one of
the out-buildings, and now she set herself very
patiently to wait beside it until the mouse should
come out. She had to wait for a long time too.
Perhaps the mouse had heard the two friends
prowling about. At any rate, it lay so still in
its hole that no one would have guessed it was
there at all except a cat. At length, toward
evening, the mouse thought it might be safe to
venture out. But scarcely had it poked its nose
out of its hole when the cat pounced upon it
and held it in her claws.</p>

<p>The mouse began to beg and plead for mercy.
“Oh, good Mrs Cat—oh, dear Mrs Cat, spare me,
I pray of you! I have a wife and five little mouselings
at home, and they would surely die of grief
if any harm came to me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am not going to hurt you,” answered the
cat, though her mouth watered to eat it. “Instead,
I am going to let you go, if you will promise
to carry a message for me to the king of the rats.”</p>

<p>When the mouse heard that the cat would let
it go, it could hardly believe in its good fortune.
It promised that it would do anything the cat
wished it to, and at once the cat took her paws
off it and set it free. Then she told it what
the message was that she wished it to carry for
her: she wished the king to send a rat to gnaw
a hole in a box so that she could get a charm that
was locked away in it; if the king would do this,
she, in return, would promise not to hurt or harm
any mouse or rat for ten long years.</p>

<p>The mouse listened attentively, and as soon as
he was sure he quite understood the message he
hurried away to carry it to the king of the rats.
He was only gone for a short time, and when
he came back he brought a stout, strong young
rat with him. This rat had been sent by the
king, who was ready to agree to the bargain the
cat had proposed, and had sent the strongest,
sharpest-toothed rat he had to gnaw the hole in
the box.</p>

<p>As soon as the cat heard this, she made her
way back into the house, while the rat and the
mouse followed close after her, leaving the dog
to wait for them outside. The cat led the way
to the upper room and showed the rat the box<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
on the chest of drawers. At once he set to work
on it. He gnawed and gnawed and gnawed, but
the wood was as hard as stone, as well as very
thick.</p>

<p>At last he gnawed through it, but the hole was
too small for him to crawl through, and he was
too exhausted to make it any larger. The cat,
indeed, could reach her paw through, and could
even feel the charm, but she could not hook it
out, though she tried again and again. But here
the mouse made itself of use. It slipped through
the hole into the box and quickly brought the
charm out in its mouth.</p>

<p>When the cat saw the charm she purred with
joy. Once again she promised the rat and mouse
that she would not even try to catch them or
any of their kind for ten years. Then she took
the charm in her mouth and ran down to where
the dog was.</p>

<p>The dog was even more delighted than she
when he saw the charm.</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear master!” he cried. “How
happy he will be.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the cat; “but now make haste.
If the people in the house discover the charm is
gone, they might suspect us, and follow us, and
try to get it back.”</p>

<p>“Come, then,” said the dog. “But, oh, my
dear master! I can hardly wait to show him
the charm.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>The cat and dog hurried on down to the river,
but when they reached the bank they met with
a new difficulty. The weather had suddenly
turned very warm and the ice had begun to melt.
In many places it was gone altogether, and where
it was left it was too thin even to bear such
small animals as themselves.</p>

<p>“And now what are we to do?” cried the cat.
“We will never be able to get back to our
village.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, we can,” replied the dog. “Do you
mount upon my back. Dig your claws deep into
my long hair and hold on tight, and I will carry
you across.”</p>

<p>The cat was terribly frightened at the thought
of such a thing, but still she saw no other way
to cross the river. She climbed upon the dog’s
back, fastened her claws well in his hair, and
then he plunged into the water and began to
swim across.</p>

<p>All went well until they neared the other bank.
A crowd of children had gathered there to see
the ice break up. When they saw the dog
swimming across with the cat on his back, it
seemed to them the funniest thing they had ever
seen in all their lives.</p>

<p>The dog was so busy swimming that he did
not even notice them, but the cat, upon his back,
saw everything that was going on. She herself
suddenly began to think what a funny thing it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
was that she should be riding at ease on the
dog’s back, while he was swimming so hard.</p>

<p>She tried not to laugh, but she was so amused
that at last she could refrain no longer. She
burst into a loud cat-laugh, and at once the
charm slipped from her mouth plump into the
river, and sank to the bottom.</p>

<p>“The charm! The charm!” the cat cried.
“I have dropped it in the river, and it has sunk
to the bottom.”</p>

<p>As soon as the dog heard that, he dived down
into the river to regain it. He was in such a
hurry that he never thought of telling the cat of
what he meant to do.</p>

<p>The cat’s claws were fastened so firmly in his
hair that she could not have let go if she had
wished. Also her mouth was open, so that when
they went down into the river she swallowed a
great deal of water. By the time the dog came
to the top again, panting and snorting, the cat
was almost drowned.</p>

<p>But the dog was too angry to think anything
of that. “Wait till we get to the shore,” he
growled. “Just wait until we get to the shore,
and see what I will do to you for dropping the
charm.”</p>

<p>But the cat had no idea of waiting for this.
As they came near the shore, she bounded from
the dog’s back to the dry land, and then she
raced away and up a tall tree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>The dog chased after her, but he could not
catch her. For some time he stood at the foot
of the tree, barking and growling, but at last
he trotted on home with drooping head and ears
and a sad heart.</p>

<p>The old man was very glad to welcome the
dog home again. He had feared it was lost. He
looked out from the door in all directions,
hoping to see the cat also, but the cat, which
had now climbed down from the tree, had gone
to look for another home. It feared the dog’s
anger too much to venture back to the hut.
Moreover, it had no liking for poverty and
hunger, and it hoped to find some place where
it would be better fed than with the old
man.</p>

<p>And now indeed there were hard times in the
hut. The old man grew poorer and poorer, and
thinner and thinner, and it was just as bad with
the faithful dog. The dog spent much of his
time down at the river looking sadly at the place
where the charm had been lost and wishing there
were some way for him to find it.</p>

<p>Now there was a great deal of fishing done in
that river, and sometimes one of the fishermen,
more kind-hearted than the rest, would throw a
fish to the hungry dog. This the dog always
carried home to his master, and the two faithful
friends would share it together. It was always
a feast day when this happened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>One day one of the fishermen, who had been
very lucky, called to the dog and threw him a
particularly large fish.</p>

<p>The dog caught it in his mouth and started
home with it. Suddenly he smelled something:
it was like the magic rice that had bubbled up
in the pot; it must be the charm; it could be
nothing but that; and the smell came from the
fish he was carrying in his mouth.</p>

<p>As soon as the dog was sure of this, he began
to run. He could not get home fast enough.
He reached the hut and bounded in and laid the
fish upon the table.</p>

<p>“Good dog! Good dog!” cried his master.
“Have you brought us a fine dinner to-day?”</p>

<p>He took his knife and began to prepare the
fish, but scarcely had he cut into it before the
blade struck against something hard. The old
man looked to see what it was, and what was his
joy and amazement to find that it was the charm,
which the fish must have swallowed.</p>

<p>The old man was so delighted that he hardly
knew how to contain himself.</p>

<p>“Oh, my precious charm!” he cried. “Oh,
what good fortune! Oh, how happy I am! Wait
until I fill the kettle, my dear little dog, and then
what a feast we will have.”</p>

<p>He took out the pot and filled it with water,
and hung it over the fire. Then he threw the
charm into it. At once the rice began to boil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
and bubble up. The whole house was filled with
the delicious smell of it.</p>

<p>It did not take long for the neighbours to find
out that the old man had his wonderful rice
again. They hastened to buy of him, and soon
he had made even more money than before.</p>

<p>One day the cat, which had grown very lean
and thin, came sneaking into the house with one
of the customers. As soon as the dog saw her
he gave a snarl and was about to fly at her, but
the old man caught the cat up in his arms. “Oh,
my dear little cat,” he cried, “how glad I am
to see you. But how thin you have grown!
Never mind; there is plenty in the house now,
and soon you will grow fat again.”</p>

<p>So the cat came back to her master again,
but for as long as she lived the dog never forgave
her, and they never became friends again. The
old man did not know that however. He loved
them both; he was quite happy to have them
as companions, and lived very prosperous and
contented until the end of his days.</p>

<h2>THE CROW PERI<br />

<small>A PERSIAN STORY</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>THERE was once a youth named Hassan,
who was so poor that he had scarcely
rags to cover him, and he was often
obliged to go hungry to bed.</p>

<p>One day Hassan went out to the forest beyond
the city and set a snare, hoping to catch a bird
or some small animal that would serve him for
a meal. After setting it, he hid himself in the
bushes near by to wait. He had not been there
long when he heard a loud flapping, and running
out he saw that a large black crow was caught
in the snare.</p>

<p>Hassan was greatly disappointed. He had
hoped for something more worth eating than
a crow. However, even that was better than
nothing. He took the bird from the snare, and
was about to wring its neck when it spoke to
him in a human voice.</p>

<p>“Hassan, Hassan, do not kill me! Spare my
life and I will make your fortune for you.”</p>

<p>Hassan was greatly surprised to hear the crow
speak, but after a moment he swallowed his
surprise and answered it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>“Make my fortune!” cried he. “How can
you make my fortune?—you, a crow? No, no,
I am hungry, and the best fortune that can
happen to me now is to have a full stomach!”</p>

<p>Again he was about to wring the bird’s neck,
but it called to him so piteously that he could
not but pause.</p>

<p>“Hassan! Hassan! You do not know what
you are doing. I am no common crow. Let me
go now, and do you return to-morrow to this
same spot and you will find something in the
snare that will be worth more to you than I can
possibly be.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Hassan. “I will let you go,
but I do this through pity, and not because I
believe in the least that you can better my
fortunes.”</p>

<p>“That is well,” said the crow. “You will see,
however, that I will keep my promise. But
before you let me go, pluck three feathers from
my wings. If you are ever in trouble, blow one
of these feathers into the air and call to me, and
I will come and give you aid.”</p>

<p>Hassan did as the crow bade him. He plucked
three feathers from its wings, but as he did so
he could not keep from laughing.</p>

<p>“You may laugh,” said the crow, “but you
will soon find that my promises are not vain.
To-morrow return to your snare, and you will
find in it something that will be of value to you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>It then spread its wings and flew away over the
tree-tops, flapping heavily.</p>

<p>Hassan returned home, but the next day he
came to the forest again. As he approached the
spot where the snare was, he gave a cry of joy
and wonder. Caught in it was the most beautiful
bird he had ever seen or dreamed of. Its
feathers were of pure silver, and over them played
the most gorgeous colours, like the colours of a
rainbow. Its eyes shone like diamonds, and its
crest was tipped with jewels of seven different
kinds.</p>

<p>“Such a bird as this is not to be eaten,” said
Hassan to himself. “It is a gift that is fit for
the King. I will take it to the palace and present
it to him, and he will be sure to reward me handsomely.”
At the same time he could not help
marvelling to think how truly the crow had
spoken.</p>

<p>The youth hastened back to the city and
borrowed a cage from a neighbour. Then he
returned to the tree, and put the wonderful bird
in the cage, and set out for the palace. He had
thrown a piece of cloth over the cage, so as to
hide the bird, but the light from it was so bright
that it shone through, and set every one to wondering
what it could be that the ragged youth
was carrying so carefully.</p>

<p>At the palace Hassan found that it was a
difficult matter to see the King. At last, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
he was allowed to come before his presence,
and at once he uncovered the cage so that the
bird could be seen.</p>

<p>The King was filled with wonder at the sight.
He had never seen such a bird before. He
questioned Hassan and made him repeat again
and again the story of how he had caught the
bird, and exactly what it was that the crow had
said to him.</p>

<p>“There is some magic in this,” said the King.
“I will keep the bird, and never before have I
received a gift that pleased me so much. I will
also prove to you that the crow spoke the truth,
for, from now on, your fortune is made.”</p>

<p>The King then caused the youth to be clothed
in magnificent garments, and he also gave him
for his own a handsome house near to the palace,
and slaves to serve him, and gold to spend.
Every day he sent for Hassan to come to him,
and because the youth was clever and handsome
and adroit, he soon became the King’s favourite
above all others.</p>

<p>But success is sure to make enemies. The
King’s former favourite became very jealous of
Hassan, and he began to scheme to destroy the
youth, and win back the King’s favour to himself.
One day he went to the King and said,
“What a pity it is that such a wonderful bird
as Hassan has brought you should be kept in a
cage! What it should have is an ivory palace,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
in which you could visit it and sit at ease to
watch it.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” answered the King, “but I
do not know how I could obtain such a palace.
There is not enough ivory in all my kingdom to
build such a thing.”</p>

<p>“It is plain enough,” answered Hassan’s enemy,
“that Hassan is the favourite of some magic
power. Ask him to build the palace, and if he
refuses, threaten him with death. Then I am
sure that in some way he will be able to provide
it for you.”</p>

<p>This the enemy said, not because he at all
believed it, but because he wished to destroy
Hassan.</p>

<p>After spending a short time in thought, the
King agreed to this plan. He sent for Hassan
and said to him, “I am, as you know, greatly
delighted with the bird that you have given me,
but now I wish for still another thing. I wish
you to build an ivory palace in which the bird
can live, and in which I can go to visit it.”</p>

<p>“Alas, your Majesty, how can I build such a
place as that?” cried Hassan. “I have nothing
of my own, as you know, but only what you yourself
have given me, and in all your kingdom there
is not enough ivory to build a whole palace of it.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, you must provide it,” answered
the King, “and if you do not do so, your life
shall answer for it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>When Hassan heard these words, he was greatly
troubled. He went out from the King’s presence
and returned home, and there he prepared to die,
for he knew not where to find enough ivory to
build one room, to say nothing of a whole palace.</p>

<p>Suddenly, in the midst of his despair, he remembered
the three feathers that he had plucked
from the crow’s wing. He feared they were lost,
but after some search he found them laid away
in a corner with the rags he had once worn. He
took them up, and blowing one of them into the
air he called upon the crow to come and help him.</p>

<p>Almost at once he heard outside a heavy flapping
of wings, and a large crow flew in through
the window and lighted beside him.</p>

<p>“What do you wish?” asked the crow, “and
why have you called upon me? Are you in
trouble?”</p>

<p>“Trouble enough,” answered Hassan, “and
trouble that may end in my losing my life.” He
then told the crow what it was that the King
had demanded of him, and that he did not see
how it would be possible for him to carry it out.</p>

<p>“Do not despair over this,” answered the crow.
“It is not such a difficult matter as you seem to
think. Ask the King to give you forty cartloads
of wine, with bullocks to pull them, and forty
slaves to drive the carts, and do you come away
with me into the forest, and I may be able to
get the ivory for you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>The youth had little hope of this. Still, he
asked the King for the things, as the crow had
bade him,—forty cartloads of wine, the bullocks,
and the forty slaves, and the King was not slow
to give them to him. Then Hassan went away
with them into the forest, and the crow flew before
to show him in which direction to go. After
they had journeyed a long distance, they came
to a pool, and all round this pool were marks
that showed that it was the drinking-place for
a great herd of elephants. There had been a
drought, however, and the water had almost
dried up.</p>

<p>The crow bade Hassan fill the pool with the
wine he had brought with him, and this he did.
Then, by the crow’s directions, Hassan hid himself
and the carts and bullocks and slaves some
little distance away.</p>

<p>Toward evening there was a great noise of
trampling and trumpeting in the forest, and a
huge herd of elephants came down to the pool to
drink. They were very thirsty, for the supply of
water had been low for some days. When they
found the pool full to the brim, they trumpeted
with joy and rushed to it to drink. They drank
and drank, and presently they were all overcome
with the wine and fell down and lay as though
dead.</p>

<p>Then Hassan called to the forty slaves, and they
came and cut off all the elephants’ tusks and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
loaded them upon the carts, and there were forty
cartloads.</p>

<p>Hassan and his slaves and carts left the forest
before the elephants awoke, and by the next day
they were back in the city again.</p>

<p>When the King saw the loads of ivory that
Hassan had brought with him, he could not
wonder enough.</p>

<p>Hassan’s enemy was filled with rage and envy,
but he dissembled. “Did I not know it?” said
he to the King. “I tell you there is nothing
in the world that Hassan cannot do if only he
wishes to.”</p>

<p>The ivory palace was built, and every day the
King went there to sit and watch the bird, and
Hassan was more of a favourite with him than
ever.</p>

<p>But one day Hassan’s enemy thought of a new
plot to destroy him. He went to the King and
said, “What a pity it is that such a beautiful
bird as this should never make a sound. No
doubt it could make the most ravishing music
if it would but sing.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is a pity,” answered the King, and
at once he became dissatisfied.</p>

<p>“It must be that the bird misses its former
owner,” said the enemy. “If Hassan really
wished to please you, he would find the former
owner and bring him here, so that the bird might
sing again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, that is true,” said the King, “and I
would greatly like to hear it sing.”</p>

<p>He then sent for Hassan and told him what
he wished.</p>

<p>“But, your Majesty,” cried Hassan in despair,
“I do not know who was the owner of the bird,
nor have I any means for finding out. As you
know, I caught it in a snare far away from the
city, and where there is no house within sight.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless the King was determined that
Hassan must find the former owner of the bird
and bring him to the palace. If he did not, his
life should answer for it.</p>

<p>Hassan went out from the King’s presence very
sad. Then he bethought himself of the crow’s
feathers. He took one of the two that still remained,
and blew it into the air, and called to
the crow to come.</p>

<p>Almost at once the crow appeared and settled
on the ground beside him.</p>

<p>“What is it that you wish now?” it asked.
“Are you again in trouble?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am in trouble, and my trouble is very
grievous.” Hassan then told the crow what it
was that the King demanded of him.</p>

<p>“This is a more difficult matter than the former
one,” answered the crow. “Nevertheless, it may
be managed. Do you ask the King to give you
a vessel fitted out in the most complete and
magnificent way. The sails must be of silk and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
the figurehead of gold. It must be painted and
gilded within and without. There must be a
dining-hall hung about with velvet curtains, and
the dishes must be of solid gold. There must
also be a bathroom with a marble bath-tub, and
there must be damsels on the ship, dressed in
shining colours, and with bracelets and anklets
of gold set with precious stones. Do this, and
then, when the vessel is ready, I will instruct
you further.”</p>

<p>Hassan did as the crow bade him. He went
to the King and asked him for a vessel fitted out
in exactly the manner the crow had described to
him. This the King gave him.</p>

<p>When the vessel was finished, Hassan went on
board, taking the crow with him. They sailed
away and sailed away, and always the crow told
Hassan in which direction to steer. After seven
days and seven nights, they came within sight
of an island. The island was very pleasant to
look upon, for there were flowers and trees loaded
with fruit, and shining domes and palaces.</p>

<p>“Look, Hassan,” said the crow. “That is the
place whither we are bound. Now listen attentively
to what I tell you, for I can guide you no
farther; I must leave you, but if you will follow
out exactly all my directions, everything will go
well with you. That island belongs to the Queen
of the Peris. She is a very powerful fairy, and
very beautiful. She is very curious as well.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
When she sees your vessel, she will be anxious
to find out about it, whence it comes, and who
is the owner. She will send her messengers to
inquire about it. But you must answer no
questions, and you must let no one but the Queen
herself come on board. She will wish to go all
over the vessel, and when she sees the bathroom
she will admire it so much that she will wish to
take a bath there. This you must agree to.
Then, while she is bathing, you must sail away
with her, for she is the owner of the Wonder Bird,
and for her and her alone will it sing.”</p>

<p>Hassan promised to do exactly as the crow bade
him in all things, and then it spread its wings
and flew away and out of sight. Hassan ordered
the captain to sail the vessel up close to the shore
of the island, and there they dropped anchor.</p>

<p>Presently he could see that they had been
observed from the island. People gathered on
the shore, many of them magnificently dressed,
and presently several boats put out and were
rowed over to the ship’s side. In them were
messengers from the Queen.</p>

<p>These messengers questioned Hassan as to
whence the vessel came and whose it was. But
Hassan would answer none of these questions.
Neither would he allow them to come on board
to examine the vessel, though they greatly wished
it, and it had been, indeed, their Queen’s commands
that they should do so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>“If the Queen wishes to know about the vessel,
she must come herself,” said Hassan.</p>

<p>The messengers returned to shore very much
dissatisfied. But presently another boat put
forth from the shore, and in it was the Queen
herself. She was rowed over to the ship’s side,
and she said to the youth that she would now come
on board herself and bring her maidens with her.</p>

<p>She was so beautiful and so magnificent that
Hassan scarcely knew how to refuse her. However,
he remembered the crow’s words, and was
determined to obey them.</p>

<p>“Your majesty, if you will do me the honour
to enter my ship, it and all that are in it are
yours,” he said; “but as to anyone’s coming on
board with you, that I cannot allow, for I was
expressly forbidden to permit anyone but yourself
to visit the ship.”</p>

<p>The Queen was very much offended by Hassan’s
words. Still, she was so very curious that she
could not resist coming on board to see whether
the ship was really as magnificent within as it
seemed from the outside.</p>

<p>The youth showed her all over it, and she was
filled with admiration at the beauty and completeness
of its furnishing. When she entered
the room where the marble bath was, she was
particularly delighted, and after examining all
the arrangements she signified to Hassan that
she would like to bathe in the marble tub.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>Hassan at once retired and sent the damsels
he had brought with him to attend the Queen.</p>

<p>While she was bathing, the sails were set, and
the ship sailed away from the island and back
across the sea toward Hassan’s own country.</p>

<p>When the Queen had finished bathing, and had
returned to the deck, she was amazed to find the
ship under way and the island already lost to
view. She commanded Hassan to carry her back
at once to her island, but this the youth would
in nowise consent to do. He explained to the
Queen why it was that he had carried her off—that
it was to save his own life. He said that
later on, if she wished, she might return to her
own country, but first she must see whether the
bird belonged to her, and whether it would sing
for her. He also told her so many pleasant
things about the King, his master, that the Queen
became quite curious to see him.</p>

<p>“I make no doubt from what you tell me,”
said she, “that the bird is one that I lost some
time ago. If it is, I shall be glad to make it sing
for your master, but after that I must of course
return home, and I shall take the bird with me.”</p>

<p>The youth doubted whether the King would
agree to this, but he kept his thoughts to himself,
and at last brought the Queen to the city and
into the King’s palace.</p>

<p>When the King saw the lady Hassan had
brought with him, he was amazed at her beauty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
He could think of nothing else. Even the bird
was forgotten. He caused her to sit at his right
hand and did all he could to entertain her.</p>

<p>The Queen was no less pleased with him, and
some time was spent in talking pleasantly together.</p>

<p>“And now, your Majesty,” said the Queen at
last, “let us visit the ivory palace where the
Wonder Bird is kept, and see whether it is mine,
and if it is, I can promise you that it will immediately
begin to sing, and that its voice is as
beautiful as its plumage.”</p>

<p>The King at once arose, and together they went
to the ivory palace. No sooner had the Queen
crossed the threshold than the bird burst into
song, and its song was so beautiful that all who
heard it stood as though enchanted. They could
not stir, nor scarcely breathe until the song was
ended.</p>

<p>After the first day at the King’s palace, the
Queen spoke no more of returning to her own
island. She had fallen deeply in love with the
King, and he with her.</p>

<p>Before long they were married, and then Hassan
became more of a favourite with them than ever.
Wealth and honours were heaped upon him, and
there was nothing that the King and Queen were
not ready to do for him.</p>

<p>The former favourite was more filled with rage
and envy than ever. He could scarcely eat or
sleep, he was so envious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>Now after the King and Queen had been
married for little more than a year the Queen
fell ill, and her illness was so grievous that all
the doctors in the kingdom could do nothing
for her. At last it seemed as though she must
surely die.</p>

<p>When this became known, Hassan’s enemy
went to the King and said, “Your Majesty, I am
but an ignorant man. I know you think nothing
of me or my words, but is it not possible that
there is some drug in the Queen’s own country
that might cure her? And if so, why should
not Hassan be sent to fetch it for her? For he
and he alone knows where her island lies.”</p>

<p>This the enemy said because he hoped that if
Hassan returned to the island the people there
would either kill him or make a prisoner of him
because he had carried off their Queen.</p>

<p>The King, however, never thought of that. He
thought only of what might save the Queen’s life.
The advice he received seemed to him very wise.
He at once sent for Hassan and told him what
he wished him to do—that he was to return to
the Queen’s own country, and demand of her
court physician some drug that would make her
well.</p>

<p>Hassan thoroughly understood how dangerous
this errand might prove. He knew, too, why his
enemy had suggested it; that it was not through
any love of the Queen, but from hatred of him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>However, he said nothing of this to the King.
He only agreed to what his master wished and
at once made ready to set out. First, however,
he took out the third feather that the crow had
given him, blew it into the air, and called the
crow to come to him.</p>

<p>At once the crow appeared.</p>

<p>“What would you have of me now?” it asked
of the youth. “Has some new trouble come
upon you?”</p>

<p>“That I do not know,” answered Hassan, “but
the King is sending me upon a mission that may,
it seems to me, prove very dangerous.”</p>

<p>He then told the crow what it was that the
King required of him.</p>

<p>The crow seemed greatly disturbed when it
heard of the Queen’s illness. “You must go,”
it said, “and go at once. There is indeed a drug
in the Queen’s palace that will save her life if
you can but fetch it in time. You will suffer
no harm from the people in the palace. They
will, indeed, give you the drug at once when they
learn that the Queen is in need of it. But at
the gateway of the palace there are two fierce
lions. These would certainly tear you to pieces
before ever you could enter, unless you had my
help to depend on.”</p>

<p>The crow then bade the youth look carefully
at its right wing. “You will find there a single
silver feather,” it said. “Pluck it out and carry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
it with you. When the lions spring at you, you
must at once touch them with that feather, and
then they will become gentle, and you can pass
them by unharmed.”</p>

<p>The crow stooped before Hassan and spread
wide its wings, and Hassan saw that the third
feather from the tip of the right wing was of pure
silver. He plucked it out, and having hidden
it in a safe place in his clothing, he started out
on his journey. For seven days and seven nights
he sailed across the seas in the same direction as
he had gone before, and on the morning of the
eighth day he came within sight of the island.
He landed and made his way toward the palace,
and he saw no one on his way. No sooner did
he approach the gateway than two fierce lions
sprang out and rushed at him as though to tear
him to pieces.</p>

<p>Hassan was terrified at their appearance. It
seemed as though he must surely lose his life,
but he stood firm until they were almost upon
him, and then he touched them with the feather.
At once they became perfectly gentle, and even
fawned at his feet as though he were their master.
So Hassan passed by them unharmed and entered
the palace.</p>

<p>Those who were there were very much surprised
to see a stranger enter. They could not understand
how it was he had been able to pass by
the lions without being torn to pieces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>The youth explained the matter to them, however,
and showed them the silver feather. He
also told them the sore need of their Queen, and
begged them, if they had any drug that could save
her, to bring it to him at once and let him go.</p>

<p>The people of the palace looked at him strangely
when he showed them the feather. But when
he made known the illness of the Queen they
hastened to fetch a drug she always used, and
gave it to him.</p>

<p>“This will save her,” they told him, “for she
has often used it to bring back life when it was
almost gone.”</p>

<p>They then escorted him to the seashore, showing
him the greatest honour, and many of them wished
to return with him to the King’s country, but this
he dared not allow.</p>

<p>It was again seven days and seven nights before
Hassan came to the end of the journey, and by
that time the King was in despair. He had no
longer any hope. However, when he heard that
the ship had arrived, he sent his swiftest horses
and riders to meet Hassan and bring him to the
palace.</p>

<p>The youth was at once taken into the room
where the Queen was lying stretched upon a
couch, seemingly lifeless. The King, the court
physician, and her attendants were with her.</p>

<p>“Have you brought it? The drug?” cried the
King.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>Hassan drew it forth from his bosom, where
he carried it, and placed it in the hands of the
Queen’s physician. He did not notice that the
crow had followed him into the room.</p>

<p>The physician poured a few drops of the drug
into a goblet and held it to the Queen’s lips. No
sooner had she swallowed it than a wonderful
change came over her. The colour returned to
her cheeks and the life to her limbs. She opened
her eyes and sat up and looked about her.</p>

<p>At once her eyes fell upon the crow, and it
was to it that she addressed her first words.</p>

<p>“Oh, thou careless and disobedient one!” she
cried, “into what danger didst thou not throw
thy mistress.”</p>

<p>“Alas!” answered the crow, “thou hast indeed
been near to death. But all that is over now.
There is only happiness before thee. But for me,
is my misery never to end?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and that right soon,” cried the Queen.
“If I owe my danger to thee, so also do I owe
to thee my happiness. Draw near to me.”</p>

<p>All in the room had listened in wonder to this
talk between the Queen and the crow. But a
still stranger thing was to happen.</p>

<p>As the crow hopped close to the couch, the
Queen took a few drops of water from a vial near
by and sprinkled it over the bird, at the same
time pronouncing some magic words.</p>

<p>At once, instead of the crow, a tall and graceful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
maiden stood there before the Queen, a maiden
of such great beauty that she was even the equal
of the Queen herself.</p>

<p>The King and Hassan were filled with wonder
at this sight.</p>

<p>The Queen then turned to the King with a
gentle smile.</p>

<p>“This maiden,” said she, “was my favourite
of all the Peris that once attended me. But she
grew proud and haughty because of my favour,
and at last presumed to disobey even me. To
punish her, I changed her into a crow and sent
her to fly about the world, despised by all. But
I will now forgive her because she brought me
to you, and will take her back into favour if she
can assure me of her repentance.”</p>

<p>The Peri sank on her knees before the Queen
and kissed her hand, weeping. She assured her
mistress that her pride was indeed broken, and
that from now on she would be her faithful and
obedient servant.</p>

<p>The Queen then raised her from her knees
and made her sit beside her, and all was joy and
happiness.</p>

<p>As for Hassan, he found the maiden so beautiful
that he could not keep his eyes from her. Already
he loved her with his whole heart, and longed for
nothing so much as to have her for a wife. The
Peri returned his love, and with the consent of
the King and Queen they were married, and from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
that time on they lived in the greatest joy and
contentment.</p>

<p>As for the former favourite, he was so miserable
over the sight of Hassan’s happiness that at
length he could bear it no longer. He sold his
house and goods and sailed away, no one knew
whither, and if anyone regretted him, it was not
Hassan.</p>

<h2>THE FOUR WISHES<br />

<small>A GERMAN STORY</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>THERE was once a baron so rich and
powerful that only the king himself was
greater. He was very fierce and warlike,
and what he wished for he took from rich and
poor alike, and none was able to withstand him.</p>

<p>The baron had a very gentle and beautiful wife.
Often she wept bitterly over the evil deeds her
husband did in the world, but this the baron
never knew, for she was careful to hide her tears
from him.</p>

<p>One day the lady was sitting beside a fountain
in the gardens, and she was very sad. Presently
she leaned her head on her hand and began to
weep. Suddenly the waters of the fountain were
disturbed, and up from the midst of them arose
the figure of a nixie or water spirit.</p>

<p>The lady was frightened at such a strange sight,
but the nixie spoke to her gently and bade her
not be afraid.</p>

<p>“I,” said she, “am the spirit who watches over
the fortunes of the castle. I have come to tell
you that within a year a child will be born to
you—a little girl. This child will suffer many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
things, both dangers and sorrows. There is only
one way in which she can be protected. If
you will make me her godmother I will be able
to guard her and bring her safely through her
troubles, but in no other way can she be saved
from them.”</p>

<p>The lady was filled with amazement at what
she heard. She had known there was a spirit
that watched over the fortunes of the castle, and
now she promised eagerly that if a child came
to her the nixie should be its godmother.</p>

<p>At once the nixie smiled at her and waved its
hand, and then sank back again into the waters
of the fountain.</p>

<p>In less than a year, as the nixie had foretold,
a little daughter was born to the lady, a child
as beautiful as the day. The time for christening
the child was set. She was to be called Matilda,
after her mother, but the lady refused to say who
was to stand godmother to the child. A godmother
she had chosen, but she would tell no
one who that godmother was.</p>

<p>The hour of the christening arrived, all the
ladies and gentlemen of the court were gathered
together, and still no godmother. Suddenly, without
a sound, a stranger appeared among them.
She was dressed from head to foot in silver
that shone and rippled like running water, and
a silver veil was wound about her head. At once
the Lady Matilda recognized her as the nixie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>The water spirit took her place as godmother
to the child, and the christening proceeded.
When it was over, every one looked to see what
gift the godmother would give the child. They
had no doubt that it would be something very
rare and handsome, but instead it was only a
common little carved wooden ball, such as ladies
sometimes use to carry perfume in. This the
godmother placed in the child’s hand. Then,
turning to the lady, she said, “Guard carefully
this ball which I have given to the child. Place
it in some safe place for her. Her good fortune—yes,
even her life itself—depends upon this ball.”</p>

<p>After saying this, the stranger at once disappeared,
and none could tell where she went,
nor how.</p>

<p>The Lady Matilda took the ball and put it
away among her jewels in a strong chest, and
orders were given that no one should touch or
disturb it. As soon as the little Matilda was old
enough, the mother meant to give the ball to her
and tell her of its value.</p>

<p>Before that time, however, and while the child
was still very young, the lady died, and the ball
was forgotten. The little Matilda grew up, knowing
nothing of its worth; indeed, she did not even
know that there was such a thing in the castle.</p>

<p>Not long after his wife’s death the baron
married again. His second wife was a very handsome
woman, but she was cold and proud and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
envious. From the first day she saw Matilda,
she hated the child because of her beauty and
her gentleness. She treated her so unkindly that
Matilda was very unhappy. She was worse fed
and clothed than any servant in the castle, and
the meanest room and the hardest bed were
given to her. Still she grew in beauty day by
day, and every one except the stepmother loved
her for her gentle ways and her sweetness.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/i_202fp.jpg" width="450" height="558" alt="Nixie rising out of water to talk to Matilda" />
<div class="caption">“DO NOT BE AFRAID, MY CHILD,” SAID THE NIXIE
TO MATILDA</div>
</div>

<p>One day the stepmother wished to examine
the jewels that had once belonged to the Lady
Matilda. She intended to choose from among
them such as she might admire. She had the
jewel casket brought to her room, and unlocked
it and began to examine the ornaments that
were in it. Some of them she decided to keep,
but others she threw aside. At last, hidden away
in a corner, she came upon a common little carved
wooden ball.</p>

<p>“What is this?” she asked. “Why should
this have been locked away with the jewels as
though it were valuable?”</p>

<p>Her ladies whom she had brought with her to the
castle could not tell her, and she disdainfully threw
the ball out through the open window of her room.</p>

<p>Now it so chanced that Matilda was passing
under the window at that very time, and the
ball fell directly at her feet. Surprised, she
stooped and picked it up, and examined it. The
top seemed to be screwed on, but though she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
tried again and again she could not unscrew it.
However, Matilda took the greatest fancy to the
ball. Through the day she carried it in her
pocket or the bosom of her dress, and at night
she slipped it under her pillow, and somehow she
felt quite happy and contented now in spite of
the unkindness of her stepmother.</p>

<p>One day Matilda sat down beside the fountain
in the garden, and, as usual, she began to play
with the ball, tossing it up into the air and catching
it again. Suddenly the ball slipped from her
fingers and fell into the fountain. Matilda bent
over and tried to reach it, but it had floated
beyond her reach. Then a hand appeared in the
waters and seized it, and the figure of the nixie
rose out of the fountain.</p>

<p>“Do not be afraid, my child,” said the nixie
to Matilda. “I wish you nothing but good. I
am your godmother, and it was I who gave this
ball to your mother to keep for you until you
were old enough to take charge of it yourself.
Unfortunately she died before that time arrived.
It is well you have found it at last, for the time
is at hand when you will need it. Listen well
to what I now tell you. This ball contains three
wishes which you can use at any time. But be
careful. Only in the time of your greatest need
must you use its magic, for after it has given
you three wishes, its power will be gone, and it
can do nothing more for you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>The nixie then told Matilda that there was one
other way in which the ball could aid her. If
at any time she wished to become invisible, she
had only to hold it in her hand and say:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 2em;">“Light to guide me,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Dark to hide me,</span></div>
<div class="verse">Let no harm nor ill betide me.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class='unindent'>No one then would be able to see her until she
wished to become visible again.</p>

<p>At once, after saying this, the nixie disappeared,
dissolving back into the waters, but the ball she
left lying on the grass beside the fountain.</p>

<p>Matilda picked it up and slipped it into her
bosom, and then went back to the castle, very
grave and thoughtful.</p>

<p>Now in the years while Matilda was growing
to womanhood, the baron’s enemies had grown
very strong, so strong indeed that they no longer
feared him. A plan was made to attack him in
his castle, to take him prisoner, and to rob him
of the possessions that he himself had stolen from
others. The attack was planned for a certain
night when there would be no moon, and it
would be too dark for those inside the castle to
see their enemies approach.</p>

<p>Matilda went to bed early that evening, and
soon fell asleep. She slept for only a few hours,
however. Suddenly, just before midnight, she
was awakened by a great uproar and confusion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
The assault had begun. The baron’s enemies
had surrounded the castle. They entered in and
captured the baron and his wife, and presently
they came to the door of Matilda’s room and
began to break down the door. The poor girl
was overcome with terror.</p>

<p>Suddenly she remembered the charm the nixie
had taught her. She caught up the wooden ball
from under her pillow, and in a whisper she
repeated:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 2em;">“Light to guide me,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Dark to hide me,</span></div>
<div class="verse">Let no harm nor ill betide me.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>At once she became invisible. The door was
broken open, and the foemen came into the room,
but they saw no one. Matilda, indeed, was there
close beside them, but they could not see her,
and she was careful not to brush against them.
Unseen, she passed from the room and down the
stairs and out of the castle. There was a light
in the heavens now, a red glow of flames, for the
castle had been set on fire.</p>

<p>Matilda hurried away, and when she had gone
far enough to feel that she was safe, she wished
and became visible again. Just as day was breaking,
she came to a deep forest. So far she had
seen no one, but before venturing farther she
gathered roots and herbs, and with them she
stained her face and hands so that no one would
have known her. She looked like a gipsy, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
some poor servant-maid in search of work. She
had now no fear of robbers, for who would think
of stopping anyone so poor and miserable-looking
as she?</p>

<p>All day she travelled through the forest, and
by night she came out on the other side of it
and saw before her a great castle. Matilda
knocked at the door and humbly begged the
woman who opened it to take her in and give
her food and shelter. In return for such help
she would gladly do any work that might be
needed about the castle.</p>

<p>Now it so happened that the old woman was
the housekeeper, and she was in need of a scullery-maid.
Matilda, with her poor clothes and her
darkened hands and face, looked just the one
for such a place.</p>

<p>“If you are willing to work,” said the housekeeper,
“it may be that we can strike a bargain.
You may begin by scouring these pots and pans.
If you do it well, I will keep you here as
scullery-maid.”</p>

<p>Matilda at once set to work, and soon had the
kettles and pans shining like new. The housekeeper
was very much pleased, and decided to
engage her. So Matilda became a scullery-maid
in the castle. Sometimes she helped the cook,
for she was very clever in cookery.</p>

<p>Now the nobleman to whom this castle belonged
was a young and handsome count named<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Conrad. His father was dead and his mother
was anxious to see him married; but never yet
had the count seen any lady who attracted him
sufficiently.</p>

<p>At last the old countess decided to give a ball
for the count, and to invite to it all the most
beautiful ladies from the country round. Among
them all she hoped her son would see some one
whom he would care to make his wife.</p>

<p>The invitations were sent out, and everywhere
there was great excitement. Not only was the
count young and handsome; he was also as rich
as a prince, and so courteous that he was beloved
by all. There were few among the ladies who
did not hope that they might be chosen as his
bride.</p>

<p>At the castle nothing was talked of but the
ball that was to be given for the count. Matilda
listened to all that was said, and the more she
heard, the more she wished that she too might
go to the dance and mingle with the other ladies.
All the while she had been at the castle she had
kept the ball with her, but she had been careful
not to use any of the three wishes it contained.
But now the time had come when she determined
to try its power. The night of the ball Matilda
finished her work early, and then she stole away
to her room and fastened the door so that no one
could come in.</p>

<p>First of all she took water and washed off the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
stain from her face and hands. When this was
done, her skin was once more as fair as a lily,
and her cheeks as red as roses. She shook down
her wonderful hair so that it fell in a cloud
about her. She combed and braided it, and
then she took out the little wooden ball and
held it in her hand.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Little ball, I hold you close;</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Little ball, I hold you tight;</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">By your magic power I pray</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Grant my wish to me to-night,”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p class='unindent'>she whispered. And then, “I wish,” she said,
“for a gown more beautiful than any that ever
was seen, and for ornaments to go with it—jewels
for my neck and jewels for my hair, and slippers,
and a fan to wave in my hand.”</p>

<p>At once, upon the bed, appeared a gown more
beautiful than Matilda had ever dreamed of. It
was woven all of silver, and set with pearls, and
with it there were ornaments for her neck and
hair and a fan of shining plumes; and on the
floor beside the bed stood a tiny pair of satin
slippers embroidered with pearls and threads of
silver.</p>

<p>Trembling with haste, Matilda dressed, for
already the night was late, and when at last
she stood clothed all in silvery white, the whole
room shone with the light of her beauty.</p>

<p>She stole down the stairs unnoticed, and it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
not long before she reached the old countess’s
house where the ball was being held. Many
beautiful ladies were there, the loveliest in the
land, but when Matilda entered the ballroom,
she outshone them all as the moon outshines the
stars at night.</p>

<p>From the moment he saw her Count Conrad had
eyes for no one else, and there was no one else
with whom he would dance. Before the end of
the evening he drew her aside into another room.</p>

<p>“Listen,” said he. “Never before in all my
life have I seen anyone as beautiful as you, nor
one whom I could love as already I love you.
Tell me, I pray, who you are. Only some great
lady or princess could be as beautiful as you.”</p>

<p>Matilda was filled with joy when the count said
he loved her, but immediately after she became
sad, for she thought that if he learned she was
only a kitchen-maid in his castle, he would no
longer care for her.</p>

<p>“Look, I beg of you,” she said, “and see
whether there is not some one listening at the door.”</p>

<p>The count thought Matilda wished to tell him
some secret, and he at once went to the door to
make sure that no one could overhear it.</p>

<p>Matilda drew the wooden ball from her pocket
and whispered:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 2em;">“Light to guide me,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Dark to hide me,</span></div>
<div class="verse">Let no harm nor ill betide me.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>At once she became invisible, and she slipped
past the count and hurried back to the castle.</p>

<p>When the count turned, he was very much
surprised to find that his beautiful partner had
disappeared. He could not imagine what had
become of her. He hunted for her everywhere,
and asked every one which way she had gone,
but no one had seen her.</p>

<p>He was very much disquieted at this. However,
there was to be another ball the next night,
and Count Conrad felt sure Matilda would appear
at it also. This time he was determined she
should not leave him until he knew who she was
and whence she came. To make sure of this, he
decided to set a guard about the house, with
orders to follow any strange lady who passed
out alone, and watch where she went.</p>

<p>All the next day but little was to be heard
anywhere but talk of the wonderful stranger,
of how beautiful she had been, and how
magnificently dressed, and of how much the
count had admired her. Every one wondered
whether she would appear again at the second
ball.</p>

<p>When evening came, Matilda made haste to
finish her work, and then stole away to her little
garret room. Taking the ball in her hand, she
said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Little ball, now serve me right,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Grant the wish I wish to-night.</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p class='unindent'><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>I wish I may have a gown even more beautiful
than the one I wore last night, and all ornaments
that should go with it.”</p>

<p>At once the room was filled with light, and
Matilda saw, lying upon the bed, a gown made
entirely of cloth of gold, and set with precious
stones. There were jewels for her neck and arms,
and a pair of golden slippers that shone like glass.
Matilda dressed in haste, and throwing a dark
cloak over her, she stole away through the night
to the ball.</p>

<p>Count Conrad had been watching for her. He
would, indeed, look at no one else, and as soon
as she entered, he hastened to her side.</p>

<p>If she had been beautiful the night before,
she was far more so now. Then she had shone
like the moon, but now she glittered like the sun,
so that it dazzled the eyes to look at her.</p>

<p>The count begged her to dance with him, and
as soon as he could, he drew her aside into
another room. He then took from his hand a
ring, and placing it upon her finger, he said,
“Now you are my own true love, for you wear
my ring upon your finger. But tell me, I pray
of you, who you are and whence you come, that
I may ask your hand in marriage in a proper
manner.”</p>

<p>“Alas, my mother is dead,” answered Matilda,
“and my father, I fear, has also been put to
death by cruel enemies.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>So saying she dropped her fan. The count at
once stooped to pick it up. Quick as thought, as
he stooped, Matilda drew her ball from her pocket
and whispered the magic charm:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 2em;">“Light to guide me,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Dark to hide me,</span></div>
<div class="verse">Let no harm nor ill betide me.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>At once she became invisible, and slipping from
the room, she hastened back to the castle.</p>

<p>When the count looked up and found that his
beautiful partner had once more disappeared, he
was in despair. He searched through every room,
and then sent for his guards and questioned them
closely. None of them could tell him anything
of the stranger, however. Not one had seen her
pass by. This was not strange, for Matilda had
remained invisible until she reached the castle.
She was even then in her little attic room, slipping
off her beautiful clothes, and staining her face and
hands that she might again appear as the kitchen
wench.</p>

<p>Again the count had lost her. But now he
determined to give a ball himself. He caused it
to be made known that this ball was in honour
of the unknown beauty, and he had no doubt
but that she would appear at it as she had
at the other two. This time he determined
that not for one instant would he lose sight of
her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>The count’s ball was to be much more magnificent
than those that the old countess had given.
All the servants in the castle were set to work
preparing for it, and Matilda was no less busy
than the others. She had not a moment to
herself.</p>

<p>The night of the ball arrived, and there was still
much to be done in the kitchen. Matilda began
to see that there would be no chance for her to
slip away from her work and appear at the ball.</p>

<p>She did indeed ask the housekeeper to allow
her an hour that she might go outside and peep
in through a window at the dancers, but the
housekeeper refused her angrily.</p>

<p>“Look in through the windows!” she cried.
“What are you thinking of? You would frighten
the ladies to death with your gipsy face and your
big eyes. No; do you stay here in the kitchen
where you belong, and do your work in a proper
manner.”</p>

<p>Matilda would not disobey her, but as she
scoured the pots and pans, she could not prevent
the tears from falling. She could think of nothing
but Count Conrad, of how handsome he was, and
how kind and gentle.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the count was standing close to the
door of the ballroom, waiting for the beautiful
stranger to appear. Great coaches rolled up to
the entrance of the castle. Beautiful ladies in
silks and satins and jewels swept through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
rooms. They waved their fans and smiled at
the count, but he had no eyes for any of them.
His thoughts were all of Matilda. Little he
guessed that even then she was scouring kettles
in the kitchen below and weeping as she scoured.</p>

<p>As hour after hour passed and she did not
appear, the count’s heart grew heavy with grief.
By the time the ball was over and his guests
were leaving, he was quite ill with disappointment.
He could hardly stand to bid them farewell.
The beautiful stranger had not come, and
now he feared he would never see her again.</p>

<p>The next day word passed through the castle
that the young count was unable to leave his bed.
He had fallen ill through grief and disappointment.
Doctors were sent for, but they could do
nothing for him. One thing could cure him and
one alone, and that was some knowledge of the
beautiful stranger who had danced with him.</p>

<p>Matilda had managed to win the confidence of
the old housekeeper, and now she went to her
and said, “I have heard how ill the count is and
how all the medicines the doctors have given
him have failed to help him. If you will but
let me, I can make a broth of such wonderful
qualities that if the count will but taste of it
he will be cured.”</p>

<p>At first the housekeeper refused, but Matilda
still urged and entreated, until at last the old
woman grew tired of saying ‘no’ to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>“Very well, then,” she said. “It will do no
harm for you to make a bowl of broth, but as to
its having the power to cure the count, that, of
course, I do not believe.”</p>

<p>Matilda at once set to work, and as she was
very clever at cooking, she made a broth so rich
and delicious that it made the mouth water just
to smell of it. It was as clear as crystal, and
of a rich amber colour. When it was done, she
put it in a silver bowl and covered it over with
a napkin, but before doing this she managed to
drop into it the ring that the count had given her.</p>

<p>The broth was so good that the housekeeper
was delighted with it, and she herself carried it
up to her master’s room.</p>

<p>When she entered with it, the count turned
away his head. “Why do you come here?” he
said. “Do not trouble me. I wish for nothing.”</p>

<p>But the housekeeper would not be sent away
in this manner. “I have brought you a bowl of
broth,” she said, “and it is so delicious that if you
will but taste of it, I am sure you will be better.”</p>

<p>With these words she uncovered the bowl and
placed it before the count, and the broth was
so clear that at once he saw the ring lying at
the bottom of it.</p>

<p>“What is this!” he cried. “Who has made
this broth? Tell me immediately.”</p>

<p>The housekeeper was frightened at his look and
tone. “It is good broth,” she cried; “the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
of broth, I am sure, even though it was made by
our little kitchen-maid.”</p>

<p>“Whoever made it, send her to me at once,”
demanded the count.</p>

<p>The housekeeper was very much concerned.
She hurried away to the kitchen.</p>

<p>“What is to be done now?” she said to
Matilda. “The count demands to see you, but
the sight of your rags and dark face would surely
throw him into a fever. This is a pretty piece
of work!”</p>

<p>“Do not be troubled,” said Matilda. “I will
wash my face and hands, and then do you lend
me your cloak and your long veil. With them I
can cover myself so that he will not be able to
see what I look like.”</p>

<p>To this the housekeeper agreed, as she could
think of no better plan.</p>

<p>Matilda took the cloak and veil and hastened
away with them to her own room. There she
combed her hair and washed off the stain, and
then she put on her golden dress and her jewels,
which she had kept hidden away since the night
of the ball. When she was dressed, she covered
herself carefully with the cloak and veil, so that
even the housekeeper’s prying eyes could not
catch a glint of the finery beneath. So disguised,
Matilda went up to Count Conrad’s room
and stood modestly just inside the doorway.</p>

<p>The count had been waiting for her impatiently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
and as soon as she entered, he said, “Was it you
who made the broth the housekeeper brought to
me?”</p>

<p>“It was I,” answered Matilda.</p>

<p>“And who was it who put the ring in it?”</p>

<p>“It was I.”</p>

<p>“Then tell me,” cried the count, “who gave
you the ring. How came you by it?”</p>

<p>“It was you yourself who gave me the ring,
and it was you who placed it on my finger,”
said Matilda.</p>

<p>With these words she put aside the veil and
dropped the cloak from her shoulders. There
she stood before him, blushing, and filling all the
room with the light of her beauty.</p>

<p>The count was transported with joy. “You
have come!” he cried, “and you have come at
the time when I most despaired of finding you.
Now we will be married, and never again shall
you leave me.”</p>

<p>At these words Matilda grew very sad. “Alas,
that may not be,” said she. “Have you forgotten
that I am only your kitchen-maid?”</p>

<p>But the count loved her too dearly to care for
that. “You will be my wife,” he said, “and then
who will dare to remember what you were before?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but there is another reason why we can
never, never marry,” sighed Matilda. “You will
agree with me as to that when I tell you that
my father was your father’s bitterest enemy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who was your father?” asked the count,
wondering.</p>

<p>Matilda then related to him her whole story,
who her father was, how her mother had died
while she was still a child, and about her stepmother
and her nixie godmother. She also told
him of how she had chanced to come to his castle
and take service there.</p>

<p>The count listened to all she had to say, and
when she had come to an end, he took her in
his arms and embraced her tenderly.</p>

<p>“I care not who you are,” he said, “nor
whence you come. I know only that I love
you, and that you and you alone shall be my
bride.”</p>

<p>Matilda was very happy when she heard this.
She already loved the count dearly, and now she
could no longer refuse him.</p>

<p>Almost at once preparations for the wedding
were begun, and people from far and near were
invited to come to it.</p>

<p>The first to be asked was the count’s mother,
a proud and covetous old woman. She had been
the one who was most eager for her son to marry,
but when she heard whom he had chosen for a
bride, that it was the daughter of an enemy, and,
moreover, a girl both poor and homeless, she was
filled with rage.</p>

<p>At once she hastened to the castle, and urged
and entreated the count to give up Matilda, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
he would not listen to her. He loved his bride
too tenderly for that.</p>

<p>When his mother found that all her efforts to
separate them were in vain, she left the castle
in a fury, and drove away to her home. Never
again, she vowed, would she set foot in the castle
as long as Matilda was there, and the time would
come when the young count would bitterly regret
his choice of a wife.</p>

<p>Count Conrad was grieved at his mother’s
anger, but he was too happy with Matilda to
grieve long. He and she were soon married, and
so sweet and gentle was her character that every
day the count loved her better and was more
contented with his choice.</p>

<p>When the count and Matilda had been married
for a year, a child was born to them, a little boy
so handsome and big and strong that the count
was filled with joy and pride.</p>

<p>The nurse who had charge of the child was
sent to the castle by the old countess, and both
the count and Matilda were delighted at what
they took to be a sign that his mother had forgiven
them. This was not the case however.
The old countess still hated Matilda with a bitter
hatred, and had sent the nurse, hoping she might
find some way to injure her, and if possible to
separate her from the count.</p>

<p>Matilda always slept with the baby’s cradle close
to her own bed. One night, when all the castle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
was wrapped in sleep, the old nurse slipped into
the room, and lifting the child carefully from the
cradle, she carried it away without waking anyone.</p>

<p>In the morning, as soon as Matilda awoke, her
eyes as usual turned first of all to the cradle.
She was greatly surprised to see that it was
empty, and at once called the nurse and demanded
what had become of the child.</p>

<p>The nurse pretended to be equally surprised.
“I do not know,” she answered. “When I last
saw him, he was asleep in the cradle beside your
ladyship.”</p>

<p>Matilda was very much alarmed. The count
was called, the castle searched thoroughly, and
every one was questioned, but they could find no
trace of the baby.</p>

<p>“It must be some evil spirit or enchantress
who has carried him away,” said the nurse.
“Last night I heard a beating of wings outside
my window, and a strange sound of sighing and
moaning, but I thought it was only some great
bird that was lost in the night.”</p>

<p>This the nurse said not because she had really
heard anything, but because this was part of a
plot that she and the old countess had hatched
between them.</p>

<p>Days passed, and still nothing was heard of
the child. The count was in despair. Even
Matilda herself was scarcely more dear to him
than his infant son.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>At the end of a year another child was born
to Matilda, and this also was a son, a child as
strong and handsome as the first.</p>

<p>But again, when the infant was only a few
weeks old, the nurse stole it away secretly in
the night, without being seen by anyone. In the
morning the cradle was empty, and no trace of
the child could be found anywhere.</p>

<p>The count was filled with grief and anguish.
In his heart he secretly blamed Matilda because
she had not awakened when the child was carried
away. But he restrained himself from reproaching
her. He could not help treating her somewhat
coldly, however, and Matilda was grieved to
the heart not only over the loss of the child, but
because she feared her husband no longer loved
her.</p>

<p>At the end of the year, still a third child was
born, and now, in order to make sure that it
should not be stolen, a watch was kept over the
infant—by day and night; and though he slept
by Matilda’s side, there was always some one
else in the room with them.</p>

<p>But even this precaution could not keep the
nurse from carrying out her wicked plans. When
the child was still only a few weeks old, she
managed one evening to put a sleeping potion
in the repast that was served to Matilda, and in
that of the attendant as well.</p>

<p>Night came and the child was laid in the cradle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
close to Matilda’s bed. The attendant took her
place at the door. It was not long, however,
before Matilda and the attendant fell into a deep
sleep. The nurse then stole into the room, and
lifting the child from the cradle, she carried it
away with her as she had the two others.</p>

<p>When morning came, and it was discovered
that this child too had been stolen, the count
could restrain himself no longer. The woman
who had been in attendance was thrown into
prison, and he heaped reproaches on Matilda for
having allowed this third child, the most beautiful
of them all, to be stolen from her side.</p>

<p>“You should not be surprised,” said the wicked
nurse, “and the attendant is not to blame. There
is some enchantment in this, and if you will come
aside with me into a private room, I will tell
you of some things I have seen here in the castle
in the last three years.”</p>

<p>The count was in a state to listen to anything,
and he allowed the nurse to speak to him in
private, and to tell him the story that she and
the old countess had arranged between them.</p>

<p>She told him that though Matilda seemed so
fair and gentle, she was in reality a wicked enchantress.
This his mother had known, and it
was for this reason she had been so unwilling
that he should marry her, and for no other cause.
During the night when the child was stolen, the
nurse said, she had been awakened by a beating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
of wings, and had stolen to the door and looked
out. There she had seen Matilda talking with
a being that from its looks could be nothing
but an evil spirit. Presently (so the nurse said)
Matilda had gone back into her chamber, and
when she returned she was carrying the child,
and she had given it into the hands of the strange
being. “After that,” said the nurse, “I saw
no more, for I was afraid to look. But I make
no doubt that that is what has become of all
the children, and that the young countess caused
the attendant to fall into an enchanted sleep so
that she might have a chance to give the baby
to the evil spirit.”</p>

<p>The count was so distracted with grief that he
was ready to believe anything. He remembered
what Matilda had told him of her godmother the
nixie, and it seemed to him possible that this
water spirit had some power over her that might
cause her to sacrifice her children. In his distraction
he sent for his mother to question her
as to what she knew.</p>

<p>The old countess had been waiting for this
summons. She came to him at once and in haste,
and her heart was full of evil joy at the thought
that at last she was to have Matilda in her power.</p>

<p>When she appeared before her son, however,
she dissembled her joy, and pretended to be sad.</p>

<p>“Alas, my dear son,” said she, “what I feared
has come to pass at last. I would have warned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
you before that the bride you had chosen was
a wicked enchantress, but I knew you would
not listen to me. Now, however, she has shown
herself in her own wicked character. She has
sacrificed her children to an evil spirit, and it
is only right that she should be punished for her
wickedness.”</p>

<p>The count knew not what to answer to this.
He still loved Matilda, but if she had done such
a wicked thing as to give her children to an evil
spirit, she must suffer for it.</p>

<p>“What you say may be true,” said he to his
mother. “As for me, I am so distracted that I
no longer seem to understand anything. I will
go away on a long journey, and I will leave
Matilda in your hands. Do as you think best
with her, only treat her as gently as you can.”</p>

<p>As soon as the count had said this he left his
mother and went away, and it was well for his
mother that he did so. She was so overjoyed
at the way her plans had turned out that she
could no longer hide her satisfaction. The count
left the castle without bidding farewell to his
wife. Matilda was cut to the heart when she
found he had left her without a word. She was
also terrified at the thought that now the old
countess had her in her power.</p>

<p>Matilda had indeed good cause for fear. As
soon as the count had gone, his mother caused
an iron room to be built. All about this room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
were ovens arranged in such a way that the room
could be made so hot that it would be impossible
for anyone to remain in it for long and live.
After it was finished, Matilda was induced to go
into it, and as soon as she was inside, the door
was shut and locked.</p>

<p>The moment Matilda found that she had been
locked in the room alone, she suspected some
evil. She looked about her for a way of escape,
but the walls were of iron, and the room had
been built in such a way that there were no
windows.</p>

<p>“Alas,” said Matilda, “are my misfortunes
never to end? Oh, my dear husband, how had
you the heart to leave me here alone and in the
power of that wicked woman?”</p>

<p>In her despair Matilda threw herself down upon
the floor of the room. As she did so, she felt
something hard in the pocket of her dress. She
slipped her hand into it and drew out the wooden
ball that she had so long forgotten. One more
wish was left to her. Now, if ever, was her time
of need. Holding it in her hand she whispered:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Little ball, so great my need,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Only you can help indeed;</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Save me now and set me free,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Give my children back to me.”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Without her willing it, the ball slipped from
her fingers and fell upon the floor, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
broken to pieces. From these fragments arose a
silvery mist that spread through the room and
filled it with a refreshing coolness. In the midst
of the mist appeared the nixie, and in her arms
she carried three beautiful little boys. They
were the children who had been stolen from
Matilda.</p>

<p>The nixie smiled upon her godchild and spoke
in a voice like the flowing of cool waters. “At
last you have remembered me and my gift,”
she said. “Long have I been waiting for you
to call upon me, my child. Now I am here, and
no harm can come to you. Look! Here are the
three children that the wicked old countess caused
to be thrown into the water, thinking to drown
them. But I saved them. They have been safe
in my care until you should call upon me, and
now I restore them to you.”</p>

<p>So saying, she placed the children in Matilda’s
arms, and the mother clasped them to her, weeping
with joy.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the men who had been in charge
of the ovens that were to heat the room found
that in spite of all they could do the walls of it
remained cool. They went to the old countess and
told her this. “Our fires are burning brightly,”
they said, “and are so hot that we can scarcely
go near them, and yet the walls of the room
are even cooler than when we began.”</p>

<p>The countess could not understand how this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
could be. She was about to go and probe the
mystery when she heard a clatter of hoofs outside,
and a sound of loud voices. She looked
from a window, and saw to her surprise and alarm
that it was her son returning to the castle.</p>

<p>The count, indeed, had been unable to bear the
thought of having left Matilda in his mother’s
care. He feared some harm might come to her,
and the farther he went, the more anxious he
had grown. At last he had turned his horse and
ridden back with all speed to tell Matilda that
he still loved her, and that whatever their sorrow
was, they would bear it together.</p>

<p>As soon as the old countess saw her son, she
knew that her plots had failed, and she feared
his wrath when he should find his wife shut in
the iron room. She determined not to wait for
that, and calling the wicked nurse, they escaped
together from the castle and fled away, nobody
knew whither.</p>

<p>As for the count, he hurried through the castle,
searching everywhere for Matilda, and at last he
came to the iron room. When he found that
she was locked inside it, and saw the ovens all
about it, he was like one distracted.</p>

<p>He turned the key and threw open the door,
but he scarce dared look inside. He dreaded
what he might see there.</p>

<p>When he did summon courage, however, what
was his wonder to see not only his wife, but there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
in her arms the three children they had lost. He
could hardly believe his eyes and was well-nigh
crazy with joy. Flinging himself on his knees
before her, he begged her to forgive him for
having doubted her and for having left her as
he had done.</p>

<p>Matilda, who was all mildness and sweetness,
raised him from his knees and placed the children
in his arms.</p>

<p>“See,” said she, “you have no longer any
reason to mistrust me. These are our own dear
children whom the nixie has returned to us.”</p>

<p>She then told the count the whole story, and
when she came to an end they kissed each other
and the children, and from that time on they
lived in mutual love and happiness.</p>

<p>As for the wicked old countess, unless she died
of spite, she may be living and wandering over
the world to this very day.</p>

<h2>WHY THE ANIMALS NO LONGER
FEAR THE SHEEP<br />

<small>A FRENCH CREOLE STORY</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>LONG, long ago, when the animals were not
as wise as they are now, they were all
very much afraid of the sheep. Even the
lion and tiger were afraid of him. They had
never seen him angry, but he had such a solemn
look, and his beard was so long, and his horns
so strong and curly, that they were sure he would
be very dangerous indeed if he were once roused.</p>

<p>One day old Papa Sheep invited Mr Tiger to
come and spend the day with him, and he also
invited him to bring Little Tiger along to play
with Little Sheep, for Mr Tiger’s little boy was
just the same age as Papa Sheep’s little boy.</p>

<p>Mr Tiger was very pleased at this invitation.
He was glad to come himself, and he was glad
to have Little Tiger become friendly with Little
Sheep, for after a while Little Sheep would
probably grow up and be just as big and strong
and dangerous as his father was.</p>

<p>Mr Tiger and his little boy arrived quite early
in the morning at the sheep’s house, and they
brought a present with them, so that Papa Sheep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
would feel pleased with them. The present they
brought was a basket of nice fresh green things
such as all sheep like.</p>

<p>Papa Sheep thanked them for the present, and
patted Little Tiger on the head, and then he
told the two children to run out of doors and
play, because he and Mr Tiger wanted to talk
big talk together.</p>

<p>The little ones were very glad to do this, for
it was bright and pleasant outside, and they
liked it better than staying in the house.</p>

<p>Little Tiger was very frisky and frolicsome, and
Little Sheep was too. At first they ran about and
chased each other, and tried which could jump
highest, but after a while they grew rougher in
their play. Little Sheep butted Little Tiger with his
forehead, and then Little Tiger raised his paw and
gave Little Sheep a blow on the side of the head.</p>

<p>Though the Tiger was young and small, he
was also very strong, and his blow sent Little
Sheep tumbling heels over head. Little Sheep
was not angry however. He got up and laughed
and laughed. When he laughed he opened his
mouth wide, and Little Tiger was very much
surprised to see what little teeth the sheep had.
He did not say anything at the time, however,
but only went on with his play.</p>

<p>But when Little Tiger and his father were
walking home together that evening, Little Tiger
said, “Papa, I saw Little Sheep’s teeth to-day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
and he only has little, little bits of teeth. They
do not look as though they could bite anyone.”</p>

<p>“Hush, hush,” cried the Tiger. “You mustn’t
talk in that way. Some one might hear you.”</p>

<p>“But it is true,” said Little Tiger. “Why, I
wouldn’t be afraid of Little Sheep now, even if
he <i>did</i> get angry.”</p>

<p>“Will you be quiet?” cried the Tiger angrily.
“If you ever say such a thing again I will box
you so hard that you will forget whether you
ever saw his teeth or not.”</p>

<p>All the same Mr Tiger could not help wondering
whether what Little Tiger had said was true.
How strange it would be if Little Sheep only
had little weak teeth, and stranger still if Papa
Sheep’s teeth were just the same!</p>

<p>That night, after all the Tiger family had gone
to bed, Mr Tiger began to talk to his wife in a
low tone.</p>

<p>“Do you know what Little Tiger said to-day?”</p>

<p>“No; how should I know? Some nonsense,
no doubt.”</p>

<p>“He said he saw Little Sheep’s teeth, and that
they were so small and weak he did not believe
he could bite anybody.”</p>

<p>“Oh! oh! be quiet,” cried his wife. “Are
you crazy to talk so? Suppose some one heard
you, and went and told Papa Sheep what you
had been saying. He certainly would come and
tear us all to pieces.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr Tiger said nothing in answer to this, but
the less he said, the more he thought. At last
he made up his mind to find out for a certainty
whether Papa Sheep had biting teeth or no. For
this purpose he in his turn invited Papa Sheep
and Little Sheep to come and spend the day
with him and his family.</p>

<p>Papa Sheep accepted the invitation, and on the
day named he and Little Sheep arrived bright
and early at the tiger’s house.</p>

<p>As before, the little ones went out of doors to
play, and the big animals sat and talked inside
the house.</p>

<p>Presently Mr Tiger brought out a bottle of
wine and set it on the table, and he and the sheep
began to drink together. The more Papa Sheep
drank, the merrier he grew. He quite lost his
solemn look. He began to laugh loudly, and he
threw back his head and opened his mouth so
wide that the tiger could see every tooth he had.
And very poor teeth they were too—so small and
weak that they were not fit for biting anything
tougher than grass.</p>

<p>When Mr Tiger saw how small the sheep’s
teeth were, he became very angry. He was in
a rage to think he had ever been afraid of Papa
Sheep, and had treated him with respect. With
a roar he sprang at the old sheep, and gave him
such a blow with his paw that the sheep fell
down dead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>Little Tiger, outside, heard the noise, and he
ran and looked in at the window. As soon as
he saw what had happened, he called to Little
Sheep, “Run, Little Sheep! Run away, quick!
My papa is biting your papa, and if you do not
run away he will bite you next.”</p>

<p>When Little Sheep heard this he was very much
frightened. He did not stop to ask any questions.
He took to his heels and ran home, crying bitterly
all the way.</p>

<p>Old Mother Sheep saw him coming and hurried
out to meet him. “What is the matter?” she
cried. “Where is your father, and why are you
crying so bitterly?”</p>

<p>“Oh! oh!” wept Little Sheep. “The Tiger!
He has bitten Papa to pieces, and I’m afraid he’ll
come and bite me too.”</p>

<p>When Mother Sheep heard this, she too began
to weep and lament. “What shall we do now?”
she cried. “Where shall we go? The Tiger will
certainly come in search of us next, and tear us
to pieces as he did your father.”</p>

<p>At this the Little Sheep raised his voice and
wept more bitterly than ever.</p>

<p>Now it so chanced that when Mother Sheep
ran out to meet Little Sheep she met him under
a tall tree, and in this tree the Queen of the Birds
was sitting. The Queen heard everything the
two below her said, and she felt very sorry for
them because they were in such distress and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
terror. She flew down to a branch just over
their heads and spoke to them in a soothing
manner.</p>

<p>“I have overheard all that you have been
saying. This Tiger that you speak of is indeed
a very wicked animal. You are in great danger,
but do not be afraid. I will help you. I have
a plan that may rid us of him for ever. Do you
go back to your home. Shut yourself in and
remain there quietly until I send you further
word.”</p>

<p>When Mother Sheep heard this she was comforted,
for she saw at once that it was a queen
that was speaking to her. She promised to do
as she was told, and with Little Sheep at her
side she returned quickly to the house. There
they shut themselves in and sat down to wait
for what might happen.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Queen flew away to the forest
where she lived, and called all the birds together.
“Listen now,” she said to them. “Do you know
what the wicked Tiger has done? He has killed
poor old Papa Sheep, who never did harm to anyone.
We all know how cruel the Tiger is, but
this is the worst thing he has done yet. It is
time for us to rid the forest of him.”</p>

<p>The Queen then told them that she was going
to give a grand ball. To this ball she intended
to invite the Tiger. And not only should he be
invited, but he should be her own partner for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
the dance. “When the music begins, you also
must take partners,” said she. “We will all
stand up to dance, and then I will give a sign,
and all the herons must clap their wings together.
When they do this, the rest of you must instantly
hide your heads under your wings. When I make
another sign, they will again clap their wings, and
then you must take your heads out again. If
the plan I have in my mind only works out well,
we will soon put an end to this Tiger.”</p>

<p>The birds promised to obey their Queen exactly
in everything, and then she sent several of them
away to the Tiger’s house to invite him to the ball.</p>

<p>The Tiger was at home when the birds arrived,
and he was very much flattered when he heard
that the Queen wished him to come to her ball.
He was even more delighted when he found that he
was to be the Queen’s own partner in the dance.</p>

<p>He at once began to make himself ready,
smoothing his whiskers, and brushing his coat
until it shone.</p>

<p>The Tiger’s wife, however, was not at all
pleased. “What nonsense is this?” cried she.
“Why should you want to go to a ball? You
have never been to court before, and you will
not know how to act. You will be sure to do
something foolish, and then every one will laugh
at you.”</p>

<p>The Tiger became very angry when she said
this. “Of course I shall go,” he cried. “I know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
how to behave as well as anyone. You only talk
this way because you are jealous at not being
asked. If you had been invited too, you would
have been eager enough to go. But you cannot
dissuade me, whatever you say.” The Tiger then
hurried away through the forest to the place
where the ball was to be held.</p>

<p>As soon as the Queen of the Birds saw him
coming, she made haste to welcome him. A fine
feast was already spread, and the Queen made
the Tiger sit down at her right hand, and she
offered him so many delicious things that he ate
and drank a great deal more than was good for
him. She also flattered him until he hardly knew
what he was doing.</p>

<p>After the feast was ended the music began to
play, and the birds all stood up to dance. Each
one had a partner, but the Queen’s partner was
the Tiger himself, as she had promised him.
When all were in position, the Queen gave a
sign, and the great herons clapped their wings
together with a loud noise. The noise was so very
loud and so very sudden that it made the Tiger
blink, and in that moment that the Tiger blinked
all the birds hid their heads under their wings.</p>

<p>When the Tiger looked about him again he
was very much surprised to see all the birds
standing there apparently without any heads.
The Queen alone held her head high, and she
looked at him with an angry air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>“How is this?” said she. “Are these your
court manners? Do you not know that at court
no one except the Queen ever dances without
removing his head? Look about you. Do you see
even a single one of the birds with his head on?”</p>

<p>“But—but—” stammered the Tiger, “after the
dance is over, what will they do without their
heads? Your Majesty, how could I take care of
my wife and family without a head?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said the Queen smiling, “after the
dance is over they will have their heads again.
It is only while they dance that they are without
them. I will show you.”</p>

<p>With these words the Queen again gave a sign.
At once all the herons clapped their wings, and
in the instant when the Tiger blinked the birds
drew their heads from under their wings. The
Tiger looked about him. There the birds all
stood just as before, only now their heads were
in their proper places, and they were all looking
at him with a scornful air.</p>

<p>“Oh, your Majesty,” cried the Tiger, “I am
very much ashamed. I have never been to court
before, and I did not know what was expected
of me. If you will excuse me, I will run home
and get rid of my head, and then I will return
at once to dance with you.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” answered the Queen, “only do
not be gone long”; and she smiled upon him
sweetly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>At once the Tiger bounded away, but the
Queen bade a little sparrow follow him and bring
her word of what happened to him.</p>

<p>The Tiger hurried on, leaping over logs and
breaking through bushes, while the sparrow
fluttered overhead unnoticed.</p>

<p>He reached his home, and scarcely had he
crossed the threshold before he began to bawl
for his wife. “Wife! Wife! Come here, quick!
Bring an axe and chop off my head.”</p>

<p>“Are you crazy?” cried his wife. “Chop off
your head! Why should I do that?”</p>

<p>“You do not understand. I am to dance with
the Queen, and no one may do that as long as
he has a head on his shoulders.”</p>

<p>“All the better for you. Why should you
dance with her? And I certainly shall not kill
you, Queen or no Queen.”</p>

<p>When his wife said this, Mr Tiger fell into a
terrible rage. “Am I the master of the house,
or am I not?” he cried. “Do as I tell you, or
I will tear you to pieces, as I did the poor silly
Sheep.” He looked so fierce that his wife was
terrified. She ran out and got the axe. When
she returned with it, however, she again began
to argue with him. “Think, husband—think
well what you would have me do. If your head
is once off, there will be no putting it on again.
That will be the end of you.”</p>

<p>“You do not understand,” cried the Tiger.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
“The Queen will see to that. She will see that
my head is put back again after the dance.”
Then, as his wife still hesitated, he began to roar
in such a terrible manner that she almost lost
her wits, and seizing the axe, she cut off his head
in a hurry. And that was the end of him, for
even if the Queen had been able to do it, she
would not have restored the head of such a
wicked beast.</p>

<p>As soon as the sparrow had seen the end of the
Tiger, he flew back to carry the news to the Queen.
Then there was the greatest rejoicing all through
the forest. Not a single bird or beast but was
glad the Tiger was dead. No one, however,
rejoiced as heartily as Mother Sheep and Little
Sheep, for they were the ones who had been in
most danger. Now they could come out from their
house again and go about their usual business.</p>

<p>After a while, as time passed by, Little Sheep
played so hard and ate so much that he grew up
to be Big Sheep. He was larger and stronger
than his father had ever been. His beard was
longer, and his horns were curlier, and yet nobody
was afraid of him. Word had gone to all the
animals that the sheep’s teeth were too small
and weak to hurt anyone. And so it has been
ever since. Not one of the animals has been
afraid of the sheep from that day to this.</p>

<h2>PRINCESS ROSETTA<br />

<small>A FRENCH FAIRY TALE</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>THERE were once a King and Queen who
had three of the most beautiful children
in the world. They loved all the children
tenderly, one no better than the others; but the
youngest, who was a girl, was always kept locked
up in a strong tower. She was allowed to see
no one but her attendants, and her parents and
her two brothers, who went every day to visit
her.</p>

<p>No one knew why she was kept shut up in
this way except the King and Queen. Even her
brothers did not know, and they often grieved
to think that their sister Rosetta should be a
prisoner all her life.</p>

<p>The fact was that when Rosetta was born a fairy
had appeared to her parents and had told them
that some time the princess would bring a great
misfortune upon her brothers. Because of her
they would be cast into a dungeon and perhaps
even lose their lives. These misfortunes would
happen when the Princess Rosetta was about to
be married.</p>

<p>The royal parents were greatly troubled at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
hearing this, and they immediately caused a high
tower to be built, and in this they placed the
child. Every luxury was hers; the most beautiful
clothes and jewels, and the most delicious
and delicately cooked food. Her furniture was of
gold and was carved in strange and wonderful
shapes, and the hangings were all woven of gold
and silver thread and richly embroidered.</p>

<p>No one, however, as was said, ever came to
the tower, or saw her, except her father and
mother and her brothers and the ladies who
waited upon her.</p>

<p>The royal parents intended to tell their sons
the reason for this imprisonment when Rosetta
should have reached the age of eighteen. Her
brothers would then understand that it was not
through any cruelty that their sister was kept
prisoner, but to protect their own lives.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, just before Rosetta’s eighteenth
birthday the King and Queen both died, and so
suddenly that they had no time to reveal to
anyone what the fairy had told them.</p>

<p>The keys of the tower were given to the elder
prince, and one of his first acts was to set
Rosetta free.</p>

<p>The princess was delighted to be able to see
at last what the world outside of her tower
was like. Everything was a wonder to her—the
trees, the grass, the flowers and fountains. She
wished to know the names of everything.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>At one spot in the gardens a peacock sat sunning
itself.</p>

<p>“What is that beautiful creature called?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“That, dear sister, is a peacock,” answered
the princes.</p>

<p>“A peacock!” cried Rosetta. “Never in my
life did I dream that such a beautiful thing existed.
I am sure that in all the world there can be nothing
else that is quite so beautiful. Dear brothers, if
you love me, find the King of the Peacocks and
bring him here, for he, and he alone, shall be my
husband. Moreover, unless you find him and bring
him to me, I shall certainly die of grief.”</p>

<p>The princes loved their sister so dearly that
they could refuse nothing that she asked of them.
They at once began to make ready to set out
into the world in search of the country of the
peacocks. Before starting they caused a portrait
of their sister to be painted. This they intended
to take with them to the Peacock country, for
they were sure that if the king of that country
could only know how beautiful Rosetta was, he
would never be contented until he had her for
his queen.</p>

<p>As soon as their preparations had been made
and the portrait was finished, the two princes
set out upon their travels. They journeyed on
and on, over many seas and many mountains
and through many strange lands, until at last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
they came to a country where there were nothing
but peacocks. There were peacock bakers and
peacock tradesmen. Peacocks went in and out
of the houses, and drove through the streets
in magnificent coaches shining with gold and
precious stones. Everywhere were only peacocks
spreading their tails and parading in all their
magnificence. Strangely enough, however, the
King who ruled over this country was not a
peacock at all, but a young man so handsome
and graceful that even the peacocks could not
equal him in beauty.</p>

<p>The princes, who had not taken long in finding
the castle, were brought before the King by the
peacocks who attended him. The brothers at
once told him that they too were sons of a king,
and that they were travelling through the world
upon a secret errand of great importance. They
did not tell him what their errand was, but after
they had been talking with him for a short time,
they began to speak of their sister, and of her
beauty and sweetness. The young King became
quite eager to see such a lovely creature, and the
brothers sent for the portrait they had brought
with them and showed it to him.</p>

<p>The King of the Peacocks had no sooner seen
it than he fell violently in love with Rosetta,
and begged them to promise her to him for a
bride. The brothers were the more ready to do
this because they had found that the Peacock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
King was not only singularly handsome, but that
he was one of the richest and most powerful
kings in the whole world.</p>

<p>Messengers were appointed to go to the princes’
country and to bring Rosetta back with them.
They were urged to make all the speed they
could, for the young King was so eager to
see the Beauty that he was ready to die with
impatience.</p>

<p>After they had gone, the King had the portrait
put where he could see it constantly, and feast
his eyes upon it, and he was only happy when
he was with it. The more he looked at it, however,
the more he doubted whether any human
being could be as beautiful as the painting. The
brothers were obliged to assure him every day
that when he saw Rosetta he would find her
even more lovely than her portrait.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the Peacock King at last,
“if I find all that you tell me is true, I will load
you with wealth and honours, but if you have
deceived me, I will surely put you to death.”</p>

<p>The brothers were not dismayed at this threat,
for they knew that it was impossible that he
should be disappointed in the beauty of their
sister.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the messengers, after many days,
reached the country where Rosetta lived. They
at once were brought before her, and when she
heard that they had come to take her to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
King of the Peacocks, she was wild with joy.
She determined to set out at once, and as the
journey was shorter by way of the sea, she made
up her mind to go in a ship rather than in a
coach and by land. She took with her only an
old nurse and her foster-sister, and her little dog
Fifine. This little dog was very wonderful, and
had been given to her by a fairy. He was of a
bright green colour and had only one ear, but
he understood everything the princess said to him,
and he knew a hundred pretty tricks.</p>

<p>The old nurse and her daughter pretended to
be very fond of Rosetta, but in truth they hated
her because she was so beautiful and beloved, and
would have been glad to injure her in any way.</p>

<p>After they had sailed along for several days,
and were almost within sight of the kingdom of
the Peacocks, the old nurse brought to Rosetta
a drink that she had mixed, and in which she
had put a sleeping potion. Rosetta suspected
nothing, and she drank all the old woman had
brought her, except for a small part that she
gave to Fifine.</p>

<p>Rosetta had scarcely swallowed the potion before
she became very drowsy. Her eyelids weighed like
lead, and before long she fell into a deep sleep.
Fifine also became very sleepy. He crawled in
under the silken covering that the princess had
drawn over her, and lay there as though dead.</p>

<p>As soon as the old nurse saw that Rosetta was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
asleep, and that nothing could awaken her, she
went to the sailors, and by means of bribes and
threats she obliged them to do exactly as she
bade them. Under her directions they carried
the mattress upon which Rosetta lay up to the
deck. The nurse looked about for Fifine, but
could not find the little dog anywhere, for it was
hidden under the coverlet. “No matter,” said
she. “I wished to keep the little animal for my
daughter, but it is probably hiding somewhere
about the ship, and I will find it later.”</p>

<p>She then made the sailors take up the mattress
and throw it overboard into the sea. This they
did without awakening either Rosetta or Fifine.
They then set all sail and sped on toward the
shores of the Peacock country, which could already
be seen before them. The wicked nurse felt sure
that it would not be long before the mattress
would become heavy with water and would sink,
so she and her daughter need trouble themselves
no more about the hated Rosetta.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the King of the Peacocks was growing
more and more impatient to see his bride.
Watchers had been placed upon the seashore to
bring him news the moment the sails of the
returning ship were seen.</p>

<p>It was on the twenty-first day after the
messengers had departed that these watchers
hastened to the palace, all out of breath, and
told the King that the ship was approaching.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>The King called his attendants about him, and
hurried down to the seashore.</p>

<p>The vessel had already come to land. The
wicked nurse had dressed her daughter in the
most magnificent of Rosetta’s clothes, which she
wore as a toad might wear the dress of a fairy.
The nurse had also bedecked her with the jewels
belonging to the princess, and last of all she had
thrown a silver veil over her, as though to guard
her beauty from the sun.</p>

<p>As the prince saw this magnificently dressed
person approaching him, he assumed it must be
his bride. He hastened to meet her, and threw
back the veil that covered her face, but when
he saw the ugliness beneath the veil he almost
fainted. He at once decided that the two princes
had deceived him; that they had tricked him
into sending for their sister and promising to
marry her because no other king had been willing
to take such a hideous creature for his wife.</p>

<p>Filled with rage, he sent his guards to take
the princes and throw them into the deepest
and darkest of the palace dungeons. He had
given his word that he would marry their sister,
and this word he could not break, but he promised
himself that upon the day when he was
married to this creature the two brothers should
die.</p>

<p>The princes, meanwhile, had also heard that
the ship had returned. They had no doubt that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
their sister was on board, and they had at once
made ready to appear before the King, to be
loaded with wealth and honours as he had promised
them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 454px;">
<img src="images/i_248fp.jpg" width="454" height="590" alt="Princess asleep, floating on mattress at sea" />
<div class="caption">THE MATTRESS UPON WHICH SHE LAY HAD FLOATED
ON AND ON</div>
</div>

<p>It was not long, indeed, before they heard a
loud knock on their door, but instead of smiling
courtiers coming to congratulate them, a guard
of soldiers had arrived, and the two brothers
were carried away, not to a grateful king, but
to a horrible dungeon where their only companions
were snakes and toads and slimy crawling
things. The princes could not understand it.
They could not imagine what had happened,
nor why they were treated in this way. The
soldiers would not answer their questions, and
after they were shut in the dungeon no living
soul came near them except the jailer, who unlocked
the door to throw in to them a few vile
crusts, and he was both deaf and dumb.</p>

<p>While the princes were lying thus imprisoned,
preparations for the wedding were being made.
A magnificent apartment had been set apart for
the bride. Everything she asked for was given
her, jewels and dresses of every kind, but the
King she never saw. He had fallen ill with rage
and disappointment, and no one could come near
him except his attendants and the doctors.</p>

<p>The old nurse and her daughter were well
content, however. The ugly girl was to become
a queen, and one of the greatest queens in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
the world, and that was enough for them. As
for Rosetta, they were sure that she had been
drowned, and that there was no need to trouble
themselves about her.</p>

<p>The princess had not been drowned however.
She was alive and well, and even more beautiful
than ever, and she was at that very moment
living in a poor hut in the outskirts of the city,
and within sight of the very castle itself.</p>

<p>After the ship had sailed away and left her,
the mattress upon which she lay had floated on
and on until at last it had stranded upon a rock
not far out from the shore.</p>

<p>The jar of striking the rock woke Fifine, for
the little dog had only swallowed a small portion
of the sleeping potion. He crawled out from
under the silken coverlet, which was trailing in
the sea, and when he saw the water all about
him and his mistress still asleep, he began to
bark as loudly as he could. The noise he made
attracted the attention of a poor old beggar who
lived in a hut not far away.</p>

<p>The old man hastened down to the water’s
edge, and with the aid of a boat-hook soon
managed to draw the mattress to shore. What
was his amazement to see a beautiful lady lying
upon it fast asleep, and a little green dog keeping
guard over her.</p>

<p>The old man tried to arouse Rosetta, but for a
long time he was unsuccessful. At length, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
she opened her eyes and sat up and looked
about her. She was amazed to find herself
stranded upon an unknown shore and with only
an old man and Fifine for her attendants instead
of safely aboard her ship, with her nurse and
foster-sister in attendance upon her.</p>

<p>“Where am I?” she cried. “Where is the
ship and where are my attendants? And who
are you, old man?”</p>

<p>The old man told her he was only a poor beggar,
and of how he had seen her mattress stranded upon
a rock and had drawn it to shore, and that this
country where she found herself was the kingdom
of the Peacocks. As to any ship, he knew nothing
of it.</p>

<p>Rosetta could not wonder enough when she
learned she was already in the Peacock country.
The old man even pointed out to her a shining
castle and a town not far away, and told her that
was the place where the King of the Peacocks
lived.</p>

<p>Seeing she was now able to raise herself and
move about, the old man invited her to come
with him to his hut. “It is but a poor place
for a great princess,” he said (for it was easy
for him to see that Rosetta was a princess), “but
at least it will be a safe shelter for you.”</p>

<p>Rosetta gladly accepted his invitation. His
hut was indeed poor and mean, but the old man
was so kind and eager to please her that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
could not but be grateful. He was greatly distressed
because he could offer her nothing to eat
but a piece of black bread and a cup of water.</p>

<p>“Do not grieve over that,” said the princess.
“Only give me a basket and we shall soon be
supplied with a fine feast.”</p>

<p>Wondering, the old man gave her a basket.
Rosetta tied it round the neck of Fifine.</p>

<p>“Fifine,” said she, “run to the palace of the
King and bring us from there a part of the
dinner that has been prepared for him.”</p>

<p>Fifine understood every word perfectly. He
at once set out, and made such good speed that
he quickly reached the palace. He slipped into
the kitchen without being seen. The King’s
dinner was done to a turn, and waiting to be
carried to him. Fifine, slipping about here and
there, managed to steal a part of everything, and
the best part at that, of the meat, the poultry,
the pastries and sweetmeats—he took some of
each, and hid it in the basket. Then he ran
away, still without being noticed, and was soon
back at the old man’s hut.</p>

<p>The old man was filled with amazement when
he saw what the dog had brought. Never had
he seen such delicious food before. The princess
sat down and he served her, and after she had
finished he ate his fill, and still there was some
left.</p>

<p>The next day Rosetta wished for some fresh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
food. She had no love for cold dishes. Again
she tied the basket round the neck of the little
dog. “Fifine,” she said, “you did very well
yesterday. To-day you must again bring me a
portion of all that the King is to have for dinner.”</p>

<p>Fifine bounded away with the basket, and it
was not long before he returned, bringing a part
of all that was to have been served to the King.</p>

<p>So it went on for some time. Every day the
best part of the King’s dinner was stolen just
before it was ready to be carried to him. Rosetta
and the old man feasted finely every day, and
the poor young King was like to die of hunger,
because every day his dinner was stolen. A
guard was set about the palace kitchen to prevent
anyone except the cook and his assistants from
going in and out, but still the food continued to
disappear; for Fifine was so small and quick that
he managed to escape the notice of the guard.</p>

<p>At last one day a little scullion, who had grown
very curious about the matter, hid himself behind
the kitchen door, determined to watch for himself.
The dinner was cooked, and ready to be put into
the dishes, when the scullion saw a little green
dog, with a basket tied about his neck, slip into
the room. The dog looked about to make sure
that no one was watching. Seeing no one, he
hastened to take the best part of the dinner
and put it in the basket. As soon as he had done
this, he slipped silently from the kitchen and ran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
off as fast as he could toward the old man’s
hut. The scullion followed him and saw where he
went. Then he returned to the palace and told
the cook what he had seen. The cook found it
hard to believe such a strange tale, but still he
repeated it to the Captain of the Guard, the
Captain told it to the Grand Councillor, the
Grand Councillor told it to the King’s favourite,
and so in time it reached the ears of the King
himself.</p>

<p>“This is a curious thing if it is true,” said the
King. “I would like to see it for myself.” So
the next day he arose, and just before dinner-time
he went down to the kitchen and hid himself
behind the door. He had not been there
long when the door was pushed open, and a
little green dog slipped into the room. The little
animal went from dish to dish, just as the scullion
had said, and helped himself until his basket
was full. Then he slipped away and ran home
to the old man’s hut, and the King followed him
without being observed.</p>

<p>His Majesty did not go as far as the hut, however.
He waited until the little dog had been
admitted and the door closed behind him, and
then he returned to his palace, very thoughtful.</p>

<p>The next day he sent to the hut for Rosetta
and the old man to appear before him. The
beggar was greatly alarmed when he received the
message.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>“See what you have brought upon us,” he
cried to the princess. “No doubt they have
discovered that it is your dog that has been
stealing the King’s dinner, and now we shall be
punished for it. Perhaps we may even lose our
lives.”</p>

<p>Rosetta, however, was not troubled. She was,
indeed, only too glad to be brought before the
King. It was what she had been hoping for.
She waited only to draw a veil over her face,
and then she was ready to go with the guard
to the palace.</p>

<p>As soon as Rosetta, with the beggar and Fifine,
entered the room where the young King was,
he was struck by the grace and dignity with
which she moved. He called her close to him
and began to question her.</p>

<p>“Who are you,” he asked, “and whence do
you come? And is it you who have caused my
dinners to disappear?”</p>

<p>To all this Rosetta answered nothing. The
King then leaned forward and drew the veil aside
from her face. As soon as he did so, the beauty
of the princess shone forth like the sun. Every
one was amazed at it. As for the King, he was
overcome with joy and wonder, for he at once
recognized her as the original of the portrait that
the princes had shown him, only her living face
was far more beautiful than the painting, even
as the sun surpasses the moon in brightness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>“Beautiful princess, whence come you?” he
cried. “Why have you hidden from me for all
these days and allowed another to take your
place? And one so hideous as she who claims
to be my bride?”</p>

<p>Rosetta told him her story as far as she knew
it, and the King listened attentively. He at once
guessed that it was the treachery of the old
nurse and her daughter that had placed Rosetta
in this situation. He sent for them to appear
before him, and while he waited for them to come,
he and the princess talked together, and so wise
she was and so witty that with every word she
said he loved her better.</p>

<p>The nurse and her daughter, when they received
the King’s message, made sure that he
had sent for them in order to arrange the time
for the wedding. They were overjoyed, and at
once put on their finest clothes. But no sooner
had they entered the audience-room, and seen
Rosetta seated on the throne beside the King,
than they almost swooned with terror. They
knew that now all had been discovered, and they
fell on their knees before him and began to
beseech him to pardon them.</p>

<p>The King was so angry at the wrong they had
done the princess that he would have sent them
to some miserable dungeon for the rest of their
lives. But Rosetta was as tender-hearted as she
was beautiful. She pleaded with him to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
mercy; so the two wicked women were spared
that fate.</p>

<p>Instead, their fine clothes were taken from
them, and they were dressed in rags and driven
from the palace, and as they were too ugly and
wicked for anyone but Rosetta to pity them,
no doubt they ended their lives in misery.</p>

<p>The two princes were brought from their
dungeons and given all the wealth and honours
the King had promised them, and when they
learned how he had been deceived, they could
not but forgive him his ill-treatment of them.</p>

<p>As for the old beggar-man, he was made rich
for life.</p>

<p>The King and the princess were married, and
lived in mutual love and happiness to the end
of their days; and as for Fifine, he slept on satin
cushions and ate the daintiest fare, and lived
long enough to play with Rosetta’s children and
show them the hundred pretty tricks he knew.</p>
